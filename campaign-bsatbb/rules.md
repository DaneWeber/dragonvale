# House Rules

1. All dice must be rolled on a hardcover D&D book.
2. Character creation ability scores are determined by rolling 24d6 and dropping the lowest 6 rolls, then distributing the dice into three-die sets for each ability score (this provides more freedom and better scores than the already generous 4d6 drop lowest method).
3. Wizards of the Coast material published in a 3.5e book is allowed by default, assuming that while the player is looking to be as effective as possible, the choices are not aimed at exploiting poorly designed content. Furthermore, anything outside of the core three books (PHB, DMG, MM) is expected to involve a meaningful trade-off.
   1. Feats, skill tricks, alternative class features, and similar all have trade-offs built in.
   2. Additional spells, such as from the _Spell Compendium_ and _Book of Exalted Deeds_, are available to core spellcasters in the following way:
      1. Bards, Sorcerers, and Wizards are free to use these spells without restriction. They already have custom spell sets available that are a subset of their class list.
      2. Clerics, Druids, Paladins, and Rangers must permanently swap out spells from their class list of equal level. These swaps must be of spells they might actually cast, so a character who would not cast an Evil spell cannot swap Evil core spells for supplemental non-Evil spells.
         1. For example, _elation_ (level 2 spell from the _Book of Exalted Deeds_) could permanently replace _gentle repose_ (also level 2) on a Cleric's spell list.
      3. Note that some prestige classes grant access to additional spell lists, such as the Celestial Mystic granting access to 13 additional Cleric spells from the _Book of Exalted Deeds_. These are available over and above the core class spell list, and do not require swaps.
4. In general, we respect published WotC rules and errata.
   1. Exceptions:
      1. Guardinals with the Polymorph spell-like ability have it, even if errata specifies it removed.
   2. Clarifications on borderline/disputed cases:
      1. "Immunity to poison" includes things that do not use the word "poison" but that Dane believes have the same vector.
         1. _Stinking Cloud_ conjures a cloud of nauseating gas which can be resisted with a Fortitude save and is related to _Cloudkill_. Just like _Cloudkill_, those immune to poison are immune to _Stinking Cloud_.
