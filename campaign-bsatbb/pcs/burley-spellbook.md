## Arcane Mark

- **School:** Universal
- **Level:** Sorcerer 0, Wizard 0
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** 0 ft.
- **Effect:** One personal rune or mark, all of which must fit within 1 sq. ft.
- **Duration:** Permanent
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No

This spell allows you to inscribe your personal rune or mark, which can consist of no more than six characters. The writing can be visible or invisible. An _arcane mark_ spell enables you to etch the rune upon any substance without harm to the material upon which it is placed. If an invisible mark is made, a _detect magic_ spell causes it to glow and be visible, though not necessarily understandable.

_See invisibility, true seeing_, a _gem of seeing_, or a _robe of eyes_ likewise allows the user to see an invisible _arcane mark._ A _read magic_ spell reveals the words, if any. The mark cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by the caster or by an _erase_ spell.

If an _arcane mark_ is placed on a living being, normal wear gradually causes the effect to fade in about a month.

_Arcane mark_ must be cast on an object prior to casting _instant summons_ on the same object (see that spell description for details).

## Black Tentacles

- **School:** Conjuration (Creation)
- **Level:** Sorcerer 4, Wizard 4
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
- **Area:** 20-ft.-radius spread
- **Duration:** 1 round/level (D)
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No

This spell conjures a field of rubbery black tentacles, each 10 feet long. These waving members seem to spring forth from the earth, floor, or whatever surface is underfoot—including water. They grasp and entwine around creatures that enter the area, holding them fast and crushing them with great strength.

Every creature within the area of the spell must make a grapple check, opposed by the grapple check of the tentacles. Treat the tentacles attacking a particular target as a Large creature with a base attack bonus equal to your caster level and a Strength score of 19. Thus, its grapple check modifier is equal to your caster level +8. The tentacles are immune to all types of damage.

Once the tentacles grapple an opponent, they may make a grapple check each round on your turn to deal 1d6+4 points of bludgeoning damage. The tentacles continue to crush the opponent until the spell ends or the opponent escapes.

Any creature that enters the area of the spell is immediately attacked by the tentacles. Even creatures who aren’t grappling with the tentacles may move through the area at only half normal speed.

- **Material Component:** A piece of tentacle from a giant octopus or a giant squid.

## Color Spray

- **School:** Illusion (Pattern) [Mind-Affecting]
- **Level:** Sorcerer 1, Wizard 1
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells

A vivid cone of clashing colors springs forth from your hand, causing creatures to become stunned, perhaps also blinded, and possibly knocking them unconscious.

Each creature within the cone is affected according to its Hit Dice.

_2 HD or less:_ The creature is unconscious, blinded, and stunned for 2d4 rounds, then blinded and stunned for 1d4 rounds, and then stunned for 1 round. (Only living creatures are knocked unconscious.)

_3 or 4 HD:_ The creature is blinded and stunned for 1d4 rounds, then stunned for 1 round.

_5 or more HD:_ The creature is stunned for 1 round.

Sightless creatures are not affected by _color spray_.

## Detect Magic

- **School:** Divination
- **Level:** Bard 0, Cleric 0, Druid 0, Sorcerer 0, Wizard 0
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** 60 ft.
- **Area:** Cone-shaped emanation
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 min./level (D)
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No

You detect magical auras. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.

_1st Round:_ Presence or absence of magical auras.

_2nd Round:_ Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.

_3rd Round:_ The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + half caster level for a nonspell effect.)

Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.

_Aura Strength:_ An aura’s power depends on a spell’s functioning spell level or an item’s caster level. If an aura falls into more than one category, _detect magic_ indicates the stronger of the two.

**————————— Aura Power —————————**

| **Spell or Object**             | **Faint**    | **Moderate** | **Strong** | **Overwhelming**    |
| ------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ---------- | ------------------- |
| Functioning spell (spell level) | 3rd or lower | 4th–6th      | 7th–9th    | 10th+ (deity-level) |
| Magic item (caster level)       | 5th or lower | 6th–11th     | 12th–20th  | 21st+ (artifact)    |
|                                 |              |              |            |                     |

_Lingering Aura:_ A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item). If _detect magic_ is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power:

| **Original Strength** | **Duration of Lingering Aura** |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Faint                 | 1d6 rounds                     |
| Moderate              | 1d6 minutes                    |
| Strong                | 1d6x10 minutes                 |
| Overwhelming          | 1d6 days                       |

Outsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if they are summoned, the conjuration spell registers.

Each round, you can turn to detect magic in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

_Detect magic_ can be made permanent with a _permanency_ spell.

## Disintegrate

- **School:** Transmutation
- **Level:** Cleric 7, Sorcerer 6, Wizard 6
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M/DF
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
- **Effect:** Ray
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw:** Fortitude partial (object)
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

A thin, green ray springs from your pointing finger. You must make a successful ranged touch attack to hit. Any creature struck by the ray takes 2d6 points of damage per caster level (to a maximum of 40d6). Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by this spell is entirely disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. A disintegrated creature’s equipment is unaffected.

When used against an object, the ray simply disintegrates as much as one 10- foot cube of nonliving matter. Thus, the spell disintegrates only part of any very large object or structure targeted. The ray affects even objects constructed entirely of force, such as _forceful hand_ or a _wall of force_, but not magical effects such as a _globe of invulnerability_ or an _antimagic field._

A creature or object that makes a successful Fortitude save is partially affected, taking only 5d6 points of damage. If this damage reduces the creature or object to 0 or fewer hit points, it is entirely disintegrated.

Only the first creature or object struck can be affected; that is, the ray affects only one target per casting.

- **Arcane Material Component:** A lodestone and a pinch of dust.

## Enlarge Person

- **School:** Transmutation
- **Level:** Sorcerer 1, Wizard 1, Cleric 1
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M
- **Casting Time:** 1 round
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
- **Target:** One humanoid creature
- **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)
- **Saving Throw:** Fortitude negates
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

This spell causes instant growth of a humanoid creature, doubling its height and multiplying its weight by 8. This increase changes the creature’s size category to the next larger one. The target gains a +2 size bonus to Strength, a –2 size penalty to Dexterity (to a minimum of 1), and a –1 penalty on attack rolls and AC due to its increased size.

A humanoid creature whose size increases to Large has a space of 10 feet and a natural reach of 10 feet. This spell does not change the target’s speed.

If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it— the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size.

All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly enlarged by the spell. Melee and projectile weapons affected by this spell deal more damage. Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any _enlarged_ item that leaves an _enlarged_ creature’s possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage, and projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them. Magical properties of _enlarged_ items are not increased by this spell.

Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack,.

_Enlarge person_ counters and dispels _reduce person_.

_Enlarge person_ can be made permanent with a _permanency_ spell.

- **Material Component:** A pinch of powdered iron.

## Expeditious Retreat

- **School:** Transmutation
- **Level:** Bard 1, Sorcerer 1, Wizard 1
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Personal
- **Target:** You
- **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)

This spell increases your base land speed by 30 feet. (This adjustment is treated as an enhancement bonus.) There is no effect on other modes of movement, such as burrow, climb, fly, or swim. As with any effect that increases your speed, this spell affects your jumping distance (see the Jump skill).

---

## Glitterdust

- **School:** Conjuration (Creation)
- **Level:** Bard 2, Sorcerer 2, Wizard 2
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
- **Area:** Creatures and objects within 10-ft.-radius spread
- **Duration:** 1 round/level
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates (blinding only)
- **Spell Resistance:** No

A cloud of golden particles covers everyone and everything in the area, causing creatures to become blinded and visibly outlining invisible things for the duration of the spell. All within the area are covered by the dust, which cannot be removed and continues to sparkle until it fades.

Any creature covered by the dust takes a –40 penalty on Hide checks.

- **Material Component:** Ground mica.

---

## Haste

- **School:** Transmutation
- **Level:** Bard 3, Sorcerer 3, Wizard 3
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
- **Target:** One creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart
- **Duration:** 1 round/level
- **Saving Throw:** Fortitude negates (harmless)
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)

The transmuted creatures move and act more quickly than normal. This extra speed has several effects.

When making a full attack action, a hasted creature may make one extra attack with any weapon he is holding. The attack is made using the creature’s full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. (This effect is not cumulative with similar effects, such as that provided by a weapon of speed, nor does it actually grant an extra action, so you can’t use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round.)

A _hasted_ creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves. Any condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses.

All of the _hasted_ creature’s modes of movement (including land movement, burrow, climb, fly, and swim) increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice the subject’s normal speed using that form of movement. This increase counts as an enhancement bonus, and it affects the creature’s jumping distance as normal for increased speed.

Multiple _haste_ effects don’t stack. _Haste_ dispels and counters _slow._

- **Material Component:** A shaving of licorice root.

## Invisibility Sphere

- **School:** Illusion (Glamer)
- **Level:** Bard 3, Sorcerer 3, Wizard 3
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M
- **Casting Time:** 
- **Range:** 
- **Area:** 10-ft.-radius emanation around the creature or object touched
- **Duration:** 

This spell functions like _invisibility,_ except that this spell confers invisibility upon all creatures within 10 feet of the recipient. The center of the effect is mobile with the recipient.

Those affected by this spell can see each other and themselves as if unaffected by the spell. Any affected creature moving out of the area becomes visible, but creatures moving into the area after the spell is cast do not become invisible. Affected creatures (other than the recipient) who attack negate the invisibility only for themselves. If the spell recipient attacks, the _invisibility sphere_ ends.

---

## Invisibility, Greater

- **School:** Illusion (Glamer)
- **Level:** Bard 4, Sorcerer 4, Wizard 4
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 
- **Range:** 
- **Target:** You or creature touched
- **Duration:** 1 round/level (D)
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)

This spell functions like _invisibility_, except that it doesn’t end if the subject attacks.

## Light

- **School:** Evocation [Light]
- **Level:** Bard 0, Cleric 0, Druid 0, Sorcerer 0, Wizard 0
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, M/DF
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Target:** Object touched
- **Duration:** 10 min./level (D)
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No

This spell causes an object to glow like a torch, shedding bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light for an additional 20 feet) from the point you touch. The effect is immobile, but it can be cast on a movable object. Light taken into an area of magical _darkness_ does not function.

A light spell (one with the light descriptor) counters and dispels a darkness spell (one with the darkness descriptor) of an equal or lower level.

- **Arcane Material Component:** A firefly or a piece of phosphorescent moss.

## Lightning Bolt

- **School:** Evocation [Electricity]
- **Level:** Sorcerer 3, Wizard 3
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** 120 ft.
- **Area:** 120-ft. line
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw:** Reflex half
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

You release a powerful stroke of electrical energy that deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to each creature within its area. The bolt begins at your fingertips.

The _lightning bolt_ sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in its path. It can melt metals with a low melting point, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, or bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the bolt may continue beyond the barrier if the spell’s range permits; otherwise, it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.

- **Material Component:** A bit of fur and an amber, crystal, or glass rod.

---

## Mage Hand

- **School:** Transmutation
- **Level:** Bard 0, Sorcerer 0, Wizard 0
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
- **Target:** One nonmagical, unattended object weighing up to 5 lb.
- **Duration:** Concentration
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No

You point your finger at an object and can lift it and move it at will from a distance. As a move action, you can propel the object as far as 15 feet in any direction, though the spell ends if the distance between you and the object ever exceeds the spell’s range.

---

## Magic Missile

- **School:** Evocation [Force]
- **Level:** Sorcerer 1, Wizard 1
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
- **Target:** Up to five creatures, no two of which can be more than 15 ft. apart
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

A missile of magical energy darts forth from your fingertip and strikes its target, dealing 1d4+1 points of force damage.

The missile strikes unerringly, even if the target is in melee combat or has less than total cover or total concealment. Specific parts of a creature can’t be singled out. Inanimate objects are not damaged by the spell.

For every two caster levels beyond 1st, you gain an additional missile—two at 3rd level, three at 5th, four at 7th, and the maximum of five missiles at 9th level or higher. If you shoot multiple missiles, you can have them strike a single creature or several creatures. A single missile can strike only one creature. You must designate targets before you check for spell resistance or roll damage.

## Mirror Image

- **School:** Illusion (Figment)
- **Level:** Bard 2, Sorcerer 2, Wizard 2
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Personal; see text
- **Target:** You
- **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)

Several illusory duplicates of you pop into being, making it difficult for enemies to know which target to attack. The figments stay near you and disappear when struck.

_Mirror image_ creates 1d4 images plus one image per three caster levels (maximum eight images total). These figments separate from you and remain in a cluster, each within 5 feet of at least one other figment or you. You can move into and through a _mirror image._ When you and the _mirror image_ separate, observers can’t use vision or hearing to tell which one is you and which the image. The figments may also move through each other. The figments mimic your actions, pretending to cast spells when you cast a spell, drink potions when you drink a potion, levitate when you levitate, and so on.

Enemies attempting to attack you or cast spells at you must select from among indistinguishable targets. Generally, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment. Any successful attack against an image destroys it. An image’s AC is 10 + your size modifier + your Dex modifier. Figments seem to react normally to area spells (such as looking like they’re burned or dead after being hit by a _fireball_).

While moving, you can merge with and split off from figments so that enemies who have learned which image is real are again confounded.

An attacker must be able to see the images to be fooled. If you are invisible or an attacker shuts his or her eyes, the spell has no effect. (Being unable to see carries the same penalties as being blinded.)

## Open/Close

- **School:** Transmutation
- **Level:** Bard 0, Sorcerer 0, Wizard 0
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, F
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
- **Target:** Object weighing up to 30 lb. or portal that can be opened or closed
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates (object)
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes (object)

You can open or close (your choice) a door, chest, box, window, bag, pouch, bottle, barrel, or other container. If anything resists this activity (such as a bar on a door or a lock on a chest), the spell fails. In addition, the spell can only open and close things weighing 30 pounds or less. Thus, doors, chests, and similar objects sized for enormous creatures may be beyond this spell’s ability to affect.

_Focus_: A brass key.

## Phantom Steed

- **School:** Conjuration (Creation)
- **Level:** Bard 3, Sorcerer 3, Wizard 3
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** 0 ft.
- **Effect:** One quasi-real, horselike creature
- **Duration:** 1 hour/level (D)
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No

You conjure a Large, quasi-real, horselike creature. The steed can be ridden only by you or by the one person for whom you specifically created the mount. A phantom steed has a black head and body, gray mane and tail, and smoke-colored, insubstantial hooves that make no sound. It has what seems to be a saddle, bit, and bridle. It does not fight, but animals shun it and refuse to attack it.

The mount has an AC of 18 (–1 size, +4 natural armor, +5 Dex) and 7 hit points +1 hit point per caster level. If it loses all its hit points, the phantom steed disappears. A phantom steed has a speed of 20 feet per caster level, to a maximum of 240 feet. It can bear its rider’s weight plus up to 10 pounds per caster level.

These mounts gain certain powers according to caster level. A mount’s abilities include those of mounts of lower caster levels.

_8th Level:_ The mount can ride over sandy, muddy, or even swampy ground without difficulty or decrease in speed.

_10th Level:_ The mount can use _water walk_ at will (as the spell, no action required to activate this ability).

_12th Level:_ The mount can use _air walk_ at will (as the spell, no action required to activate this ability) for up to 1 round at a time, after which it falls to the ground.

_14th Level:_ The mount can fly at its speed (average maneuverability).

## Polymorph

- **School:** Transmutation
- **Level:** Sorcerer 4, Wizard 4
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Target:** Willing living creature touched
- **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No

This spell functions like _alter self,_ except that you change the willing subject into another form of living creature. The new form may be of the same type as the subject or any of the following types: aberration, animal, dragon, fey, giant, humanoid, magical beast, monstrous humanoid, ooze, plant, or vermin. The assumed form can’t have more Hit Dice than your caster level (or the subject’s HD, whichever is lower), to a maximum of 15 HD at 15th level. You can’t cause a subject to assume a form smaller than Fine, nor can you cause a subject to assume an incorporeal or gaseous form. The subject’s creature type and subtype (if any) change to match the new form.

Upon changing, the subject regains lost hit points as if it had rested for a night (though this healing does not restore temporary ability damage and provide other benefits of resting; and changing back does not heal the subject further). If slain, the subject reverts to its original form, though it remains dead.

The subject gains the Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of the new form but retains its own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. It also gains all extraordinary special attacks possessed by the form but does not gain the extraordinary special qualities possessed by the new form or any supernatural or spell-like abilities.

Incorporeal or gaseous creatures are immune to being _polymorphed_, and a creature with the shapechanger subtype can revert to its natural form as a standard action.

- **Material Component:** An empty cocoon.

## Prestidigitation

- **School:** Universal
- **Level:** Bard 0, Sorcerer 0, Wizard 0
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** 10 ft.
- **Duration:** 1 hour
- **Saving Throw:** See text
- **Spell Resistance:** No

Prestidigitations are minor tricks that novice spellcasters use for practice. Once cast, a _prestidigitation_ spell enables you to perform simple magical effects for 1 hour. The effects are minor and have severe limitations. A prestidigitation can slowly lift 1 pound of material. It can color, clean, or soil items in a 1-foot cube each round. It can chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material. It cannot deal damage or affect the concentration of spellcasters. _Prestidigitation_ can create small objects, but they look crude and artificial. The materials created by a _prestidigitation_ spell are extremely fragile, and they cannot be used as tools, weapons, or spell components. Finally, a _prestidigitation_ lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects. Any actual change to an object (beyond just moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists only 1 hour.

## Prying Eyes

- **School:** Divination
- **Level:** Sorcerer 5, Wizard 5
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** One mile
- **Effect:** Ten or more levitating eyes
- **Duration:** 1 hour/level; see text (D)
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No

You create a number of semitangible, visible magical orbs (called “eyes”) equal to 1d4 + your caster level. These eyes move out, scout around, and return as you direct them when casting the spell. Each eye can see 120 feet (normal vision only) in all directions.

While the individual eyes are quite fragile, they’re small and difficult to spot. Each eye is a Fine construct, about the size of a small apple, that has 1 hit point, AC 18 (+8 bonus for its size), flies at a speed of 30 feet with perfect maneuverability, and has a +16 Hide modifier. It has a Spot modifier equal to your caster level (maximum +15) and is subject to illusions, darkness, fog, and any other factors that would affect your ability to receive visual information about your surroundings. An eye traveling through darkness must find its way by touch.

When you create the eyes, you specify instructions you want them to follow in a command of no more than twenty-five words. Any knowledge you possess is known by the eyes as well.

In order to report their findings, the eyes must return to your hand. Each replays in your mind all it has seen during its existence. It takes an eye 1 round to replay 1 hour of recorded images. After relaying its findings, an eye disappears.

If an eye ever gets more than 1 mile away from you, it instantly ceases to exist. However, your link with the eye is such that you won’t know if the eye was destroyed because it wandered out of range or because of some other event.

The eyes exist for up to 1 hour per caster level or until they return to you. _Dispel magic_ can destroy eyes. Roll separately for each eye caught in an area dispel. Of course, if an eye is sent into darkness, it could hit a wall or similar obstacle and destroy itself.

- **Material Component:** A handful of crystal marbles.

## Pyrotechnics

- **School:** Transmutation
- **Level:** Bard 2, Sorcerer 2, Wizard 2
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
- **Target:** One fire source, up to a 20-ft. cube
- **Duration:** 1d4+1 rounds, or 1d4+1 rounds after creatures leave the smoke cloud; see text
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates or Fortitude negates; see text
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes or No; see text

_Pyrotechnics_ turns a fire into either a burst of blinding fireworks or a thick cloud of choking smoke, depending on the version you choose.

_Fireworks:_ The fireworks are a flashing, fiery, momentary burst of glowing, colored aerial lights. This effect causes creatures within 120 feet of the fire source to become blinded for 1d4+1 rounds (Will negates). These creatures must have line of sight to the fire to be affected. Spell resistance can prevent blindness.

_Smoke Cloud:_ A writhing stream of smoke billows out from the source, forming a choking cloud. The cloud spreads 20 feet in all directions and lasts for 1 round per caster level. All sight, even darkvision, is ineffective in or through the cloud. All within the cloud take –4 penalties to Strength and Dexterity (Fortitude negates). These effects last for 1d4+1 rounds after the cloud dissipates or after the creature leaves the area of the cloud. Spell resistance does not apply.

- **Material Component:** The spell uses one fire source, which is immediately extinguished. A fire so large that it exceeds a 20-foot cube is only partly extinguished. Magical fires are not extinguished, although a fire-based creature used as a source takes 1 point of damage per caster level.

## Rainbow Pattern

- **School:** Illusion (Pattern) [Mind-Affecting]
- **Level:** Bard 4, Sorcerer 4, Wizard 4
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V (Brd only), S, M, F; see text
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
- **Effect:** Colorful lights with a 20-ft.-radius spread
- **Duration:** Concentration +1 round/ level (D)
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

A glowing, rainbow-hued pattern of interweaving colors fascinates those within it. _Rainbow pattern_ fascinates a maximum of 24 Hit Dice of creatures. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell’s point of origin are affected first. An affected creature that fails its saves is fascinated by the pattern.

With a simple gesture (a free action), you can make the rainbow pattern move up to 30 feet per round (moving its effective point of origin). All fascinated creatures follow the moving rainbow of light, trying to get or remain within the effect. Fascinated creatures who are restrained and removed from the pattern still try to follow it. If the pattern leads its subjects into a dangerous area each fascinated creature gets a second save. If the view of the lights is completely blocked creatures who can’t see them are no longer affected.

The spell does not affect sightless creatures.

_Verbal Component:_ A wizard or sorcerer need not utter a sound to cast this spell, but a bard must sing, play music, or recite a rhyme as a verbal component.

- **Material Component:** A piece of phosphor.
- **Focus:** A crystal prism.

## Read Magic

- **School:** Divination
- **Level:** Bard 0, Cleric 0, Druid 0, Paladin 1, Ranger 1, Sorcerer 0, Wizard 0
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, F
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Personal
- **Target:** You
- **Duration:** 10 min./level

By means of _read magic,_ you can decipher magical inscriptions on objects—books, scrolls, weapons, and the like—that would otherwise be unintelligible. This deciphering does not normally invoke the magic contained in the writing, although it may do so in the case of a cursed scroll. Furthermore, once the spell is cast and you have read the magical inscription, you are thereafter able to read that particular writing without recourse to the use of _read magic._ You can read at the rate of one page (250 words) per minute. The spell allows you to identify a _glyph of warding_ with a DC 13 Spellcraft check, a _greater glyph of warding_ with a DC 16 Spellcraft check, or any _symbol_ spell with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + spell level).

_Read magic_ can be made permanent with a _permanency_ spell.

- **Focus:** A clear crystal or mineral prism.

You blast your enemies with fiery rays. You may fire one ray, plus one additional ray for every four levels beyond 3rd (to a maximum of three rays at 11th level). Each ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 4d6 points of fire damage.

The rays may be fired at the same or different targets, but all bolts must be aimed at targets within 30 feet of each other and fired simultaneously.

## See Invisibility

- **School:** Divination
- **Level:** Bard 3, Sorcerer 2, Wizard 2
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Personal
- **Target:** You
- **Duration:** 10 min./level (D)

You can see any objects or beings that are invisible within your range of vision, as well as any that are ethereal, as if they were normally visible. Such creatures are visible to you as translucent shapes, allowing you easily to discern the difference between visible, invisible, and ethereal creatures.

The spell does not reveal the method used to obtain invisibility. It does not reveal illusions or enable you to see through opaque objects. It does not reveal creatures who are simply hiding, concealed, or otherwise hard to see.

_See invisibility_ can be made permanent with a _permanency_ spell.

- **Material Component:** A pinch of talc and a small sprinkling of powdered silver.

## Shadow Walk

- **School:** Illusion (Shadow)
- **Level:** Bard 5, Sorcerer 6, Wizard 6
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Target:** Up to one touched creature/ level
- **Duration:** 1 hour/level (D)
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

To use the _shadow walk_ spell, you must be in an area of shadowy illumination. You and any creature you touch are then transported along a coiling path of shadowstuff to the edge of the Material Plane where it borders the Plane of Shadow. The effect is largely illusory, but the path is quasi-real. You can take more than one creature along with you (subject to your level limit), but all must be touching each other.

In the region of shadow, you move at a rate of 50 miles per hour, moving normally on the borders of the Plane of Shadow but much more rapidly relative to the Material Plane. Thus, you can use this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto the Plane of Shadow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto the Material Plane.

Because of the blurring of reality between the Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane, you can’t make out details of the terrain or areas you pass over during transit, nor can you predict perfectly where your travel will end. It’s impossible to judge distances accurately, making the spell virtually useless for scouting or spying. Furthermore, when the spell effect ends, you are shunted 1d10x100 feet in a random horizontal direction from your desired endpoint. If this would place you within a solid object, you are shunted 1d10x1,000 feet in the same direction. If this would still place you within a solid object, you (and any creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty space available, but the strain of this activity renders each creature fatigued (no save).

_Shadow walk_ can also be used to travel to other planes that border on the Plane of Shadow, but this usage requires the transit of the Plane of Shadow to arrive at a border with another plane of reality. The transit of the Plane of Shadow requires 1d4 hours.

Any creatures touched by you when _shadow walk_ is cast also make the transition to the borders of the Plane of Shadow.

They may opt to follow you, wander off through the plane, or stumble back into the Material Plane (50% chance for either of the latter results if they are lost or abandoned by you). Creatures unwilling to accompany you into the Plane of Shadow receive a Will saving throw, negating the effect if successful.

## Teleport

- **School:** Conjuration (Teleportation)
- **Level:** Sorcerer 5, Wizard 5, Cleric 5
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Personal and touch
- **Target:** You and touched objects or other touched willing creatures
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw:** None and Will negates (object)
- **Spell Resistance:** No and Yes (object)

This spell instantly transports you to a designated destination, which may be as distant as 100 miles per caster level. Interplanar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn’t exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent (see below) per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. As with all spells where the range is personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is spell resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and spell resistance.

You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.

To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the Teleport table. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.

_Familiarity:_ “Very familiar” is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home. “Studied carefully” is a place you know well, either because you can currently see it, you’ve been there often, or you have used other means (such as _scrying_) to study the place for at least one hour. “Seen casually” is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. “Viewed once” is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic.

“False destination” is a place that does not truly exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.

_On Target:_ You appear where you want to be.

_Off Target:_ You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10x1d10% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly

_Similar Area:_ You wind up in an area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area.

Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell’s range, the spell simply fails instead.

_Mishap:_ You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten “scrambled.” You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time “Mishap” comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll.

| Familiarity                 | On Target | Off Target | Similar Area | Mishap |
| --------------------------- | --------- | ---------- | ------------ | ------ |
| Very familiar               | 01–97     | 98–99      | 100          | —      |
| Studied carefully           | 01–94     | 95–97      | 98–99        | 100    |
| Seen casually               | 01–88     | 89–94      | 95–98        | 99–100 |
| Viewed once                 | 01–76     | 77–88      | 89–96        | 97–100 |
| False destination (1d20+80) | —         | —          | 81–92        | 93–100 |

## Unseen Servant

- **School:** Conjuration (Creation)
- **Level:** Bard 1, Sorcerer 1, Wizard 1
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
- **Effect:** One invisible, mindless, shapeless servant
- **Duration:** 1 hour/level
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No

An _unseen servant_ is an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs simple tasks at your command. It can run and fetch things, open unstuck doors, and hold chairs, as well as clean and mend. The servant can perform only one activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity over and over again if told to do so as long as you remain within range. It can open only normal doors, drawers, lids, and the like. It has an effective Strength score of 2 (so it can lift 20 pounds or drag 100 pounds). It can trigger traps and such, but it can exert only 20 pounds of force, which is not enough to activate certain pressure plates and other devices. It can’t perform any task that requires a skill check with a DC higher than 10 or that requires a check using a skill that can’t be used untrained. Its speed is 15 feet.

The servant cannot attack in any way; it is never allowed an attack roll. It cannot be killed, but it dissipates if it takes 6 points of damage from area attacks. (It gets no saves against attacks.) If you attempt to send it beyond the spell’s range (measured from your current position), the servant ceases to exist.

- **Material Component:** A piece of string and a bit of wood.
