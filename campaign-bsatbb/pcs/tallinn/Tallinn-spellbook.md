## Barkskin

- **School:** Transmutation
- **Level:** Druid 2, Ranger 2, Cleric 2
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, DF
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Target:** Living creature touched
- **Duration:** 10 min./level
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)

_Barkskin_ toughens a creature’s skin. The effect grants a +2 enhancement bonus to the creature’s existing natural armor bonus. This enhancement bonus increases by 1 for every three caster levels above 3rd, to a maximum of +5 at caster level 12th.

The enhancement bonus provided by _barkskin_ stacks with the target’s natural armor bonus, but not with other enhancement bonuses to natural armor. A creature without natural armor has an effective natural armor bonus of +0.

## Bite of the Weretiger

- **School:** Transmutation
- **Level:** Druid 5, Sorcerer 6, Wizard 6
- **Source:** Spell Compendium (SC) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Personal
- **Target:** You
- **Duration:** 1 round/level

You snarl, and your features shift into those of a tiger. Your hands grow sharp claws, and the thick skin and striped fur of a tiger covers your body.

You gain a +12 enhancement bonus to Strength, a +4 enhancement bonus to Dexterity, a +6 enhancement bonus to Constitution, and a +5 enhancement bonus to natural armor. Your hands become claws, granting you two claw attacks, and your mouth becomes that of a tiger, giving you a bite attack. You can attack with both claws at your full base attack bonus, but your bite attack takes a –2 penalty (as if you had the Multiattack feat). Each claw deals 1d8 points of damage (1d6 if you are Small) + your Str modifier, and your bite deals 2d6 points of damage (2d6 if you are Small) + 1/2 your Str modifier. You gain the benefits of the Blind-Fight and Power Attack feats, as well. If your base attack bonus is +6 or higher, you do not gain any additional attacks.

- **Material Component:** A tiger’s claw.

## Bull’s Strength

- **School:** Transmutation
- **Level:** Cleric 2, Druid 2, Paladin 2, Sorcerer 2, Wizard 2
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M/DF
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Target:** Creature touched
- **Duration:** 1 min./level
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)

The subject becomes stronger. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, adding the usual benefits to melee attack rolls, melee damage rolls, and other uses of the Strength modifier.

- **Arcane Material Component:** A few hairs, or a pinch of dung, from a bull.

## Call Lightning

- **School:** Evocation [Electricity]
- **Level:** Druid 3
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 1 round
- **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
- **Effect:** One or more 30-ft.-long vertical lines of lightning
- **Duration:** 1 min./level
- **Saving Throw:** Reflex half
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

Immediately upon completion of the spell, and once per round thereafter, you may call down a 5-foot-wide, 30-foot-long, vertical bolt of lightning that deals 3d6 points of electricity damage. The bolt of lightning flashes down in a vertical stroke at whatever target point you choose within the spell’s range (measured from your position at the time). Any creature in the target square or in the path of the bolt is affected.

You need not call a bolt of lightning immediately; other actions, even spellcasting, can be performed. However, each round after the first you may use a standard action (concentrating on the spell) to call a bolt. You may call a total number of bolts equal to your caster level (maximum 10 bolts).

If you are outdoors and in a stormy area—a rain shower, clouds and wind, hot and cloudy conditions, or even a tornado (including a whirlwind formed by a djinni or an air elemental of at least Large size)—each bolt deals 3d10 points of electricity damage instead of 3d6.

This spell functions indoors or underground but not underwater.

## Conjure Ice Beast I

- **School:** Conjuration (Creation) [Cold]
- **Level:** Cleric 1, Druid 1, Ranger 1
- **Source:** Frostburn (FB) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, DF
- **Casting Time:** 1 round
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
- **Effect:** One conjured ice creature
- **Duration:** 1 round/level (D)
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No

This spell creates a creature constructed from magical ice. It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks your opponents to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with the creature, you can direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions.

The spell conjures one of the creatures from the 1st-level list of either the _summon monster_ table or the _summon nature’s ally_ table (pages 287–288 of the _Player’s Handbook_). The conjured creature cannot have the fire subtype. You choose which kind of creature to conjure, and you can change that choice each time you cast the spell. The conjured creature is a construct made of magical ice, gaining the ice beast template (see page 138).

In all other ways, _conjure ice beast I_ functions like _summon monster I_.

## Create Water

- **School:** Conjuration (Creation) [Water]
- **Level:** Cleric 0, Druid 0, Paladin 1
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S

- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
- **Effect:** Up to 2 gallons of water/level
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No

This spell generates wholesome, drinkable water, just like clean rain water. Water can be created in an area as small as will actually contain the liquid, or in an area three times as large—possibly creating a downpour or filling many small receptacles.

_Note:_ Conjuration spells can’t create substances or objects within a creature. Water weighs about 8 pounds per gallon. One cubic foot of water contains roughly 8 gallons and weighs about 60 pounds.

## Cure Critical Wounds

## Cure Light Wounds

- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Target:** Creature touched
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw:** Will half (harmless); see text
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless); see text

When laying your hand upon a living creature, you channel positive energy that cures 1d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +5).

Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell deals damage to them instead of curing their wounds. An undead creature can apply spell resistance, and can attempt a Will save to take half damage.

---

## Daylight

- **School:** Evocation [Light]
- **Level:** Bard 3, Cleric 3, Druid 3, Paladin 3, Sorcerer 3, Wizard 3
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Target:** Object touched
- **Duration:** 10 min./level (D)
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No

The object touched sheds light as bright as full daylight in a 60-foot radius, and dim light for an additional 60 feet beyond that. Creatures that take penalties in bright light also take them while within the radius of this magical light. Despite its name, this spell is not the equivalent of daylight for the purposes of creatures that are damaged or destroyed by bright light.

If _daylight_ is cast on a small object that is then placed inside or under a light- proof covering, the spell’s effects are blocked until the covering is removed.

_Daylight_ brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa) is temporarily negated, so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect.

_Daylight_ counters or dispels any darkness spell of equal or lower level, such as _darkness._

## Detect Magic

- **School:** Divination
- **Level:** Bard 0, Cleric 0, Druid 0, Sorcerer 0, Wizard 0
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** 60 ft.
- **Area:** Cone-shaped emanation
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 min./level (D)
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No

You detect magical auras. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.

_1st Round:_ Presence or absence of magical auras.

_2nd Round:_ Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.

_3rd Round:_ The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + half caster level for a nonspell effect.)

Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.

_Aura Strength:_ An aura’s power depends on a spell’s functioning spell level or an item’s caster level. If an aura falls into more than one category, _detect magic_ indicates the stronger of the two.

**————————— Aura Power —————————**

| **Spell or Object**             | **Faint**    | **Moderate** | **Strong** | **Overwhelming**    |
| ------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ---------- | ------------------- |
| Functioning spell (spell level) | 3rd or lower | 4th–6th      | 7th–9th    | 10th+ (deity-level) |
| Magic item (caster level)       | 5th or lower | 6th–11th     | 12th–20th  | 21st+ (artifact)    |
|                                 |              |              |            |                     |

_Lingering Aura:_ A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item). If _detect magic_ is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power:

| **Original Strength** | **Duration of Lingering Aura** |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Faint                 | 1d6 rounds                     |
| Moderate              | 1d6 minutes                    |
| Strong                | 1d6x10 minutes                 |
| Overwhelming          | 1d6 days                       |

Outsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if they are summoned, the conjuration spell registers.

Each round, you can turn to detect magic in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

_Detect magic_ can be made permanent with a _permanency_ spell.

## Detect Snares and Pits

- **School:** Divination
- **Level:** Druid 1, Ranger 1
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** 60 ft.
- **Area:** Cone-shaped emanation
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 min./level (D)
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No

You can detect simple pits, deadfalls, and snares as well as mechanical traps constructed of natural materials. The spell does not detect complex traps, including trapdoor traps.

_Detect snares and pits_ does detect certain natural hazards—quicksand (a snare), a sinkhole (a pit), or unsafe walls of natural rock (a deadfall). However, it does not reveal other potentially dangerous conditions. The spell does not detect magic traps (except those that operate by pit, deadfall, or snaring; see the spell _snare_), nor mechanically complex ones, nor those that have been rendered safe or inactive.

The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area.

_1st Round:_ Presence or absence of hazards.

_2nd Round:_ Number of hazards and the location of each. If a hazard is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location.

_Each Additional Round:_ The general type and trigger for one particular hazard closely examined by you.

Each round, you can turn to detect snares and pits in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

## Dispel Magic

- **School:** Abjuration
- **Level:** Bard 3, Cleric 3, Druid 4, Paladin 3, Sorcerer 3, Wizard 3
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No

You can use _dispel magic_ to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area, or to counter another spellcaster’s spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can’t be defeated by _dispel magic_. _Dispel magic_ can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells.

_Note:_ The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can’t be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the _dispel magic_ can take effect.

You choose to use _dispel magic_ in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counterspell:

_Targeted Dispel:_ One object, creature, or spell is the target of the _dispel magic_ spell. You make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell’s caster level. If you succeed on a particular check, that spell is dispelled; if you fail, that spell remains in effect.

If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by _monster summoning_), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.

If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item’s caster level. If you succeed, all the item’s magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface (such as a _bag of holding_) is temporarily closed. A magic item’s physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.

You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.

_Area Dispel:_ When _dispel magic_ is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot radius.

For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell (which discharges the _dispel magic_ spell so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature’s magic items are not affected.

For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel.

For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the _dispel magic_ spell, you can make a dispel check to dispel the spell.

For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the _dispel magic_ spell, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.

If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by _monster summoning_) is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object.

You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.

_Counterspell:_ When _dispel magic_ is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, _dispel magic_ may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster’s spell.

## Faerie Fire

- **School:** Evocation [Light]
- **Level:** Druid 1
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, DF
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
- **Area:** Creatures and objects within a 5-ft.-radius burst
- **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

A pale glow surrounds and outlines the subjects. Outlined subjects shed light as candles. Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness (though a 2nd-level or higher magical _darkness_ effect functions normally), _blur_, displacement, invisibility, or similar effects. The light is too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable to light. The _faerie fire_ can be blue, green, or violet, according to your choice at the time of casting. The _faerie fire_ does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined.

## Flare

- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
- **Effect:** Burst of light
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw:** Fortitude negates
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

This cantrip creates a burst of light. If you cause the light to burst directly in front of a single creature, that creature is dazzled for 1 minute unless it makes a successful Fortitude save. Sightless creatures, as well as creatures already dazzled, are not affected by _flare_.

## Guidance

- **School:** Divination
- **Level:** Cleric 0, Druid 0
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Target:** Creature touched
- **Duration:** 1 minute or until discharged
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

This spell imbues the subject with a touch of divine guidance. The creature gets a +1 competence bonus on a single attack roll, saving throw, or skill check. It must choose to use the bonus before making the roll to which it applies.

---

## Hibernate

- **School:** Necromancy
- **Level:** Cleric 5, Druid 5
- **Source:** Frostburn (FB) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, DF
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Target:** One living creature
- **Duration:** 1 week/level (D)
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

You put a creature into a state of suspended animation, slowing its life functions to almost imperceptible levels and allowing a creature to survive for weeks without food or water. This suspension of life functions automatically stabilizes a dying creature, and it can save starving or dehydrated creatures from death. Creatures affected by a hibernate spell have a slower metabolism, healing wounds at a rate of just 1 hit point per level per week.

If the target is unwilling, it is entitled a Will saving throw. A successful saving throw negates the effect of the spell; a failure allows the target an additional saving throw whenever it takes damage, when it is splashed with water or other liquids, or when 24 hours pass, whichever comes first.

## Ice Storm

- **School:** Evocation [Cold]

Great magical hailstones pound down for 1 full round, dealing 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 2d6 points of cold damage to every creature in the area. A –4 penalty applies to each Listen check made within the _ice storm_’s effect, and all land movement within its area is at half speed. At the end of the duration, the hail disappears, leaving no aftereffects (other than the damage dealt).

- **Arcane Material Component:** A pinch of dust and a few drops of water.

A light spell (one with the light descriptor) counters and dispels a darkness spell (one with the darkness descriptor) of an equal or lower level.

- **Arcane Material Component:** A firefly or a piece of phosphorescent moss.

## Wall of Coldfire

- **School:** Evocation [Cold]
- **Level:** Druid 5, Sorcerer 4, Wizard 4
- **Source:** Frostburn (FB) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, Coldfi re
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
- **Effect:** Opaque sheet of coldfire up to 20 ft. long/level or a ring of coldfire with a radius of up to 5 ft. per two levels; either form 20 ft. high
- **Duration:** Concentration + 1 round/level
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

An immobile, opaque curtain of frosty coldfire springs into existence. One side of the wall, selected by you, sends forth waves of cold, dealing 2d4 points of cold damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of cold damage to those past 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this damage when it appears and on your turn each round to all creatures in the area. In addition, the wall deals 2d6 points of frostburn damage +1 point of frostburn damage per caster level (maximum +20) to any creature passing through it.

If you evoke the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall.

The opaqueness of the coldfire grants concealment (20% miss chance) against attacks made from the opposite side of the wall. If any 5-foot length of wall takes 20 points of fire damage or more in 1 round, that length goes out. (Do not divide fire damage by 4, as for normal objects.)

_Wall of coldfire_ can be made permanent with a _permanency_ spell. A permanent _wall of coldfire_ that is extinguished by fire damage becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then reforms at normal strength.

_Coldfire Component:_ Three ounces of coldfire.
