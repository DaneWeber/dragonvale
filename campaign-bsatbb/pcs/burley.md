## Misc

Consider the following:

https://dnd.arkalseif.info/classes/metamagic-specialist/index.html
Metamagic Specialist
(Player's Handbook II variant, p. 61)

With a limited selection of spells at his fingertips, it's natural for a sorcerer to turn to metamagic feats to gain flexibility in effects.

Class Features
The metamagic specialist has all the standard Sorcerer class features, except as noted below.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain a familiar.

Benefit: You can apply metamagic feats that you know to sorcerer spells without increasing the casting time. This benefit even lets you quicken your sorcerer spells with the Quicken Spell feat.

You can use this class feature a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Int modifier (minimum 1). This is an extraordinary ability.
