- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
- **Effect:** One missile of acid

## Animate Rope

- **School:** Transmutation
- **Level:** Bard 1, Sorcerer 1, Wizard 1
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
- **Target:** One ropelike object, length up to 50 ft. + 5 ft./level; see text
- **Duration:** 1 round/level
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No

You can animate a nonliving ropelike object. The maximum length assumes a rope with a 1-inch diameter.

Reduce the maximum length by 50% for every additional inch of thickness, and increase it by 50% for each reduction of the rope’s diameter by half.

The possible commands are “coil” (form a neat, coiled stack), “coil and knot,” “loop,” “loop and knot,” “tie and knot,” and the opposites of all of the above (“uncoil,” and so forth). You can give one command each round as a move action, as if directing an active spell.

The rope can enwrap only a creature or an object within 1 foot of it—it does not snake outward—so it must be thrown near the intended target. Doing so requires a successful ranged touch attack roll (range increment 10 feet). A typical 1- inch-diameter hempen rope has 2 hit points, AC 10, and requires a DC 23 Strength check to burst it. The rope does not deal damage, but it can be used as a trip line or to cause a single opponent that fails a Reflex saving throw to become entangled. A creature capable of spellcasting that is bound by this spell must make a DC 15 Concentration check to cast a spell. An entangled creature can slip free with a DC 20 Escape Artist check.

The rope itself and any knots tied in it are not magical.

This spell grants a +2 bonus on any Use Rope checks you make when using the transmuted rope.

The spell cannot animate objects carried or worn by a creature.

## Arcane Mark

- **School:** Universal
- **Level:** Sorcerer 0, Wizard 0
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** 0 ft.
- **Effect:** One personal rune or mark, all of which must fit within 1 sq. ft.
- **Duration:** Permanent
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No

This spell allows you to inscribe your personal rune or mark, which can consist of no more than six characters. The writing can be visible or invisible. An _arcane mark_ spell enables you to etch the rune upon any substance without harm to the material upon which it is placed. If an invisible mark is made, a _detect magic_ spell causes it to glow and be visible, though not necessarily understandable.

_See invisibility, true seeing_, a _gem of seeing_, or a _robe of eyes_ likewise allows the user to see an invisible _arcane mark._ A _read magic_ spell reveals the words, if any. The mark cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by the caster or by an _erase_ spell.

If an _arcane mark_ is placed on a living being, normal wear gradually causes the effect to fade in about a month.

_Arcane mark_ must be cast on an object prior to casting _instant summons_ on the same object (see that spell description for details).

## Bear’s Endurance

- **School:** Transmutation
- **Level:** Cleric 2, Druid 2, Ranger 2, Sorcerer 2, Wizard 2
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, DF
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Target:** Creature touched
- **Duration:** 1 min./level
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

The affected creature gains greater vitality and stamina. The spell grants the subject a +4 enhancement bonus to Constitution, which adds the usual benefits to hit points, Fortitude saves, Constitution checks, and so forth.

Hit points gained by a temporary increase in Constitution score are not temporary hit points. They go away when the subject’s Constitution drops back to normal. They are not lost first as temporary hit points are.

## Black Tentacles

- **School:** Conjuration (Creation)
- **Level:** Sorcerer 4, Wizard 4
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
- **Area:** 20-ft.-radius spread
- **Duration:** 1 round/level (D)
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No

This spell conjures a field of rubbery black tentacles, each 10 feet long. These waving members seem to spring forth from the earth, floor, or whatever surface is underfoot—including water. They grasp and entwine around creatures that enter the area, holding them fast and crushing them with great strength.

Every creature within the area of the spell must make a grapple check, opposed by the grapple check of the tentacles. Treat the tentacles attacking a particular target as a Large creature with a base attack bonus equal to your caster level and a Strength score of 19. Thus, its grapple check modifier is equal to your caster level +8. The tentacles are immune to all types of damage.

Once the tentacles grapple an opponent, they may make a grapple check each round on your turn to deal 1d6+4 points of bludgeoning damage. The tentacles continue to crush the opponent until the spell ends or the opponent escapes.

Any creature that enters the area of the spell is immediately attacked by the tentacles. Even creatures who aren’t grappling with the tentacles may move through the area at only half normal speed.

- **Material Component:** A piece of tentacle from a giant octopus or a giant squid.

## Blindness/Deafness

- **School:** Necromancy
- **Level:** Bard 2, Cleric 3, Sorcerer 2, Wizard 2
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
- **Target:** One living creature
- **Duration:** Permanent (D)
- **Saving Throw:** Fortitude negates
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

You call upon the powers of unlife to render the subject blinded or deafened, as you choose.

## Blink

- **School:** Transmutation
- **Level:** Bard 3, Sorcerer 3, Wizard 3
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Personal
- **Target:** You
- **Duration:** 1 round/level (D)

You “blink” back and forth between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane. You look as though you’re winking in and out of reality very quickly and at random.

_Blinking_ has several effects, as follows.

Physical attacks against you have a 50% miss chance, and the Blind-Fight feat doesn’t help opponents, since you’re ethereal and not merely invisible. If the attack is capable of striking ethereal creatures, the miss chance is only 20% (for concealment).

If the attacker can see invisible creatures, the miss chance is also only 20%. (For an attacker who can both see and strike ethereal creatures, there is no miss chance.) Likewise, your own attacks have a 20% miss chance, since you sometimes go ethereal just as you are about to strike.

Any individually targeted spell has a 50% chance to fail against you while you’re _blinking_ unless your attacker can target invisible, ethereal creatures. Your own spells have a 20% chance to activate just as you go ethereal, in which case they typically do not affect the Material Plane.

While _blinking_, you take only half damage from area attacks (but full damage from those that extend onto the Ethereal Plane). You strike as an invisible creature (with a +2 bonus on attack rolls), denying your target any Dexterity bonus to AC.

You take only half damage from falling, since you fall only while you are material.

While _blinking_, you can step through (but not see through) solid objects. For each 5 feet of solid material you walk through, there is a 50% chance that you become material. If this occurs, you are shunted off to the nearest open space and take 1d6 points of damage per 5 feet so traveled. You can move at only three-quarters speed (because movement on the Ethereal Plane is at half speed, and you spend about half your time there and half your time material.)

Since you spend about half your time on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and even attack ethereal creatures. You interact with ethereal creatures roughly the same way you interact with material ones.

An ethereal creature is invisible, incorporeal, and capable of moving in any direction, even up or down. As an incorporeal creature, you can move through solid objects, including living creatures.

An ethereal creature can see and hear the Material Plane, but everything looks gray and insubstantial. Sight and hearing on the Material Plane are limited to 60 feet.

Force effects and abjurations affect you normally. Their effects extend onto the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, but not vice versa. An ethereal creature can’t attack material creatures, and spells you cast while ethereal affect only other ethereal things. Certain material creatures or objects have attacks or effects that work on the Ethereal Plane. Treat other ethereal creatures and objects as material.

## Blur

- **School:** Illusion (Glamer)
- **Level:** Bard 2, Sorcerer 2, Wizard 2
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Target:** Creature touched
- **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)

The subject’s outline appears blurred, shifting and wavering. This distortion grants the subject concealment (20% miss chance).

A _see invisibility_ spell does not counteract the _blur_ effect, but a _true seeing_ spell does.

Opponents that cannot see the subject ignore the spell’s effect (though fighting an unseen opponent carries penalties of its own).

## Bull’s Strength

- **School:** Transmutation
- **Level:** Cleric 2, Druid 2, Paladin 2, Sorcerer 2, Wizard 2
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells

- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Target:** Creature touched
- **Duration:** 1 min./level
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)

The subject becomes stronger. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, adding the usual benefits to melee attack rolls, melee damage rolls, and other uses of the Strength modifier.

- **Arcane Material Component:** A few hairs, or a pinch of dung, from a bull.

---

## Cat’s Grace

- **School:** Transmutation
- **Level:** Bard 2, Druid 2, Ranger 2, Sorcerer 2, Wizard 2
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Target:** Creature touched
- **Duration:** 1 min./level
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)

## Charm Person

- **School:** Enchantment (Charm) [Mind-Affecting]
- **Level:** Bard 1, Sorcerer 1, Wizard 1
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
- **Target:** One humanoid creature
- **Duration:** 1 hour/level
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

This charm makes a humanoid creature regard you as its trusted friend and ally (treat the target’s attitude as friendly). If the creature is currently being threatened or attacked by you or your allies, however, it receives a +5 bonus on its saving throw.

The spell does not enable you to control the _charmed_ person as if it were an automaton, but it perceives your words and actions in the most favorable way. You can try to give the subject orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn’t ordinarily do. (Retries are not allowed.) An affected creature never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing. Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the _charmed_ person breaks the spell. You must speak the person’s language to communicate your commands, or else be good at pantomiming.

## Comprehend Languages

- **School:** Divination
- **Level:** Bard 1, Cleric 1, Sorcerer 1, Wizard 1
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M/DF
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Personal
- **Target:** You
- **Duration:** 10 min./level

You can understand the spoken words of creatures or read otherwise incomprehensible written messages. In either case, you must touch the creature or the writing. The ability to read does not necessarily impart insight into the material, merely its literal meaning. The spell enables you to understand or read an unknown language, not speak or write it.

Written material can be read at the rate of one page (250 words) per minute. Magical writing cannot be read, though the spell reveals that it is magical. This spell can be foiled by certain warding magic (such as the _secret page_ and _illusory script_ spells). It does not decipher codes or reveal messages concealed in otherwise normal text.

_Comprehend languages_ can be made permanent with a _permanency_ spell.

- **Arcane Material Component:** A pinch of soot and a few grains of salt.

## Cone of Cold

- **School:** Evocation [Cold]
- **Level:** Sorcerer 5, Wizard 5, Cleric 6

- **Area:** Cone-shaped burst
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw:** Reflex half
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

_Cone of cold_ creates an area of extreme cold, originating at your hand and extending outward in a cone. It drains heat, dealing 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d6).

- **Arcane Material Component:** A very small crystal or glass cone.

---

## Dancing Lights

- **School:** Evocation [Light]
- **Level:** Bard 0, Sorcerer 0, Wizard 0
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
- **Effect:** Up to four lights, all within a 10- ft.-radius area
- **Duration:** 1 minute (D)
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No

Depending on the version selected, you create up to four lights that resemble lanterns or torches (and cast that amount of light), or up to four glowing spheres of light (which look like will-o’-wisps), or one faintly glowing, vaguely humanoid shape. The _dancing lights_ must stay within a 10-foot-radius area in relation to each other but otherwise move as you desire (no concentration required): forward or back, up or down, straight or turning corners, or the like. The lights can move up to 100 feet per round. A light winks out if the distance between you and it exceeds the spell’s range.

_Dancing lights_ can be made permanent with a _permanency_ spell.

## Daylight

- **School:** Evocation [Light]
- **Level:** Bard 3, Cleric 3, Druid 3, Paladin 3, Sorcerer 3, Wizard 3
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Target:** Object touched
- **Duration:** 10 min./level (D)
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No

The object touched sheds light as bright as full daylight in a 60-foot radius, and dim light for an additional 60 feet beyond that. Creatures that take penalties in bright light also take them while within the radius of this magical light. Despite its name, this spell is not the equivalent of daylight for the purposes of creatures that are damaged or destroyed by bright light.

If _daylight_ is cast on a small object that is then placed inside or under a light- proof covering, the spell’s effects are blocked until the covering is removed.

_Daylight_ brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa) is temporarily negated, so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of effect.

_Daylight_ counters or dispels any darkness spell of equal or lower level, such as _darkness._

## Daze

- **School:** Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]
- **Level:** Bard 0, Sorcerer 0, Wizard 0
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
- **Target:** One humanoid creature of 4 HD or less
- **Duration:** 1 round
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

This enchantment clouds the mind of a humanoid creature with 4 or fewer Hit Dice so that it takes no actions. Humanoids of 5 or more HD are not affected. A dazed subject is not stunned, so attackers get no special advantage against it.

- **Material Component:** A pinch of wool or similar substance.

---

## Daze Monster

- **School:** Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]
- **Level:** Bard 2, Sorcerer 2, Wizard 2

## Detect Magic

- **School:** Divination
- **Level:** Bard 0, Cleric 0, Druid 0, Sorcerer 0, Wizard 0
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** 60 ft.
- **Area:** Cone-shaped emanation
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 min./level (D)
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No

You detect magical auras. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.

_1st Round:_ Presence or absence of magical auras.

_2nd Round:_ Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.

_3rd Round:_ The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + half caster level for a nonspell effect.)

Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.

_Aura Strength:_ An aura’s power depends on a spell’s functioning spell level or an item’s caster level. If an aura falls into more than one category, _detect magic_ indicates the stronger of the two.

**————————— Aura Power —————————**

| **Spell or Object**             | **Faint**    | **Moderate** | **Strong** | **Overwhelming**    |
| ------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ---------- | ------------------- |
| Functioning spell (spell level) | 3rd or lower | 4th–6th      | 7th–9th    | 10th+ (deity-level) |
| Magic item (caster level)       | 5th or lower | 6th–11th     | 12th–20th  | 21st+ (artifact)    |
|                                 |              |              |            |                     |

_Lingering Aura:_ A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item). If _detect magic_ is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power:

| **Original Strength** | **Duration of Lingering Aura** |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Faint                 | 1d6 rounds                     |
| Moderate              | 1d6 minutes                    |
| Strong                | 1d6x10 minutes                 |
| Overwhelming          | 1d6 days                       |

Outsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if they are summoned, the conjuration spell registers.

Each round, you can turn to detect magic in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

_Detect magic_ can be made permanent with a _permanency_ spell.

## Detect Poison

- **School:** Divination

- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No

You determine whether a creature, object, or area has been poisoned or is poisonous. You can determine the exact type of poison with a DC 20 Wisdom check. A character with the Craft (alchemy) skill may try a DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check if the Wisdom check fails, or may try the Craft (alchemy) check prior to the Wisdom check.

The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

---

## Detect Secret Doors

- **School:** Divination

- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action

- **Area:** Cone-shaped emanation
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 min./level (D)
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No

You can detect secret doors, compartments, caches, and so forth. Only passages, doors, or openings that have been specifically constructed to escape detection are detected by this spell. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.

_1st Round:_ Presence or absence of secret doors.

_2nd Round:_ Number of secret doors and the location of each. If an aura is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location.

_Each Additional Round:_ The mechanism or trigger for one particular secret portal closely examined by you. Each round, you can turn to detect secret doors in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

## Dimension Door

- **School:** Conjuration (Teleportation)
- **Level:** Bard 4, Sorcerer 4, Wizard 4, Cleric 4
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
- **Target:** You and touched objects or other touched willing creatures
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw:** None and Will negates (object)
- **Spell Resistance:** No and Yes (object)

You instantly transfer yourself from your current location to any other spot within range. You always arrive at exactly the spot desired—whether by simply visualizing the area or by stating direction. After using this spell, you can’t take any other actions until your next turn. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn’t exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you.

If you arrive in a place that is already occupied by a solid body, you and each creature traveling with you take 1d6 points of damage and are shunted to a random open space on a suitable surface within 100 feet of the intended location.

If there is no free space within 100 feet, you and each creature traveling with you take an additional 2d6 points of damage and are shunted to a free space within 1,000 feet. If there is no free space within 1,000 feet, you and each creature travelling with you take an additional 4d6 points of damage and the spell simply fails.

## Disintegrate

- **School:** Transmutation
- **Level:** Cleric 7, Sorcerer 6, Wizard 6
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M/DF
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
- **Effect:** Ray
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw:** Fortitude partial (object)
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

A thin, green ray springs from your pointing finger. You must make a successful ranged touch attack to hit. Any creature struck by the ray takes 2d6 points of damage per caster level (to a maximum of 40d6). Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by this spell is entirely disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. A disintegrated creature’s equipment is unaffected.

When used against an object, the ray simply disintegrates as much as one 10- foot cube of nonliving matter. Thus, the spell disintegrates only part of any very large object or structure targeted. The ray affects even objects constructed entirely of force, such as _forceful hand_ or a _wall of force_, but not magical effects such as a _globe of invulnerability_ or an _antimagic field._

A creature or object that makes a successful Fortitude save is partially affected, taking only 5d6 points of damage. If this damage reduces the creature or object to 0 or fewer hit points, it is entirely disintegrated.

Only the first creature or object struck can be affected; that is, the ray affects only one target per casting.

- **Arcane Material Component:** A lodestone and a pinch of dust.

## Dispel Magic, Greater

## Eagle’s Splendor

- **Duration:** 1 min./level
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

The transmuted creature becomes more poised, articulate, and personally forceful. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Charisma, adding the usual benefits to Charisma-based skill checks and other uses of the Charisma modifier. Sorcerers and bards (and other spellcasters who rely on Charisma) affected by this spell do not gain any additional bonus spells for the increased Charisma, but the save DCs for spells they cast while under this spell’s effect do increase.

- **Arcane Material Component:** A few feathers or a pinch of droppings from an eagle.

A creature protected by _endure elements_ suffers no harm from being in a hot or cold environment. It can exist comfortably in conditions between –50 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit without having to make Fortitude saves). The creature’s equipment is likewise protected.

_Endure elements_ doesn’t provide any protection from fire or cold damage, nor does it protect against other environmental hazards such as smoke, lack of air, and so forth.

- **Effect:** Ray of negative energy
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

You point your finger and utter the incantation, releasing a black ray of crackling negative energy that suppresses the life force of any living creature it strikes. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit. If the attack succeeds, the subject gains 1d4 negative levels.

If the subject has at least as many negative levels as HD, it dies. Each negative level gives a creature a –1 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, ability checks, and effective level (for determining the power, duration, DC, and other details of spells or special abilities).

Additionally, a spellcaster loses one spell or spell slot from his or her highest available level. Negative levels stack.

Assuming the subject survives, it regains lost levels after a number of hours equal to your caster level (maximum 15 hours). Usually, negative levels have a chance of permanently draining the victim’s levels, but the negative levels from _enervation_ don’t last long enough to do so.

An undead creature struck by the ray gains 1d4x5 temporary hit points for 1 hour.

## Enlarge Person

- **School:** Transmutation
- **Level:** Sorcerer 1, Wizard 1, Cleric 1
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M
- **Casting Time:** 1 round
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
- **Target:** One humanoid creature
- **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)
- **Saving Throw:** Fortitude negates
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

This spell causes instant growth of a humanoid creature, doubling its height and multiplying its weight by 8. This increase changes the creature’s size category to the next larger one. The target gains a +2 size bonus to Strength, a –2 size penalty to Dexterity (to a minimum of 1), and a –1 penalty on attack rolls and AC due to its increased size.

A humanoid creature whose size increases to Large has a space of 10 feet and a natural reach of 10 feet. This spell does not change the target’s speed.

If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it— the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size.

All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly enlarged by the spell. Melee and projectile weapons affected by this spell deal more damage. Other magical properties are not affected by this spell. Any _enlarged_ item that leaves an _enlarged_ creature’s possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown weapons deal their normal damage, and projectiles deal damage based on the size of the weapon that fired them. Magical properties of _enlarged_ items are not increased by this spell.

Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack,.

_Enlarge person_ counters and dispels _reduce person_.

_Enlarge person_ can be made permanent with a _permanency_ spell.

- **Material Component:** A pinch of powdered iron.

## Erase

- **School:** Transmutation
- **Level:** Bard 1, Sorcerer 1, Wizard 1
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
- **Target:** One scroll or two pages
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw:** See text
- **Spell Resistance:** No

_Erase_ removes writings of either magical or mundane nature from a scroll or from one or two pages of paper, parchment, or similar surfaces. With this spell, you can remove _explosive runes,_ a _glyph of warding,_ a _sepia snake sigil,_ or an _arcane mark_, but not _illusory script_ or a _symbol_ spell. Nonmagical writing is automatically erased if you touch it and no one else is holding it. Otherwise, the chance of erasing nonmagical writing is 90%.

Magic writing must be touched to be erased, and you also must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against DC 15. (A natural 1 or 2 is always a failure on this check.) If you fail to erase _explosive runes_, a _glyph of warding_, or a _sepia snake sigil_, you accidentally activate that writing instead.

## Expeditious Retreat

- **School:** Transmutation
- **Level:** Bard 1, Sorcerer 1, Wizard 1
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Personal
- **Target:** You
- **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)

This spell increases your base land speed by 30 feet. (This adjustment is treated as an enhancement bonus.) There is no effect on other modes of movement, such as burrow, climb, fly, or swim. As with any effect that increases your speed, this spell affects your jumping distance (see the Jump skill).

## Feather Fall

- **School:** Transmutation
- **Level:** Bard 1, Sorcerer 1, Wizard 1
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V
- **Casting Time:** 1 free action
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
- **Target:** One Medium or smaller freefalling object or creature/level, no two of which may be more than 20 ft. apart
- **Duration:** Until landing or 1 round/level
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless) or Will negates (object)
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes (object)

The affected creatures or objects fall slowly. _Feather fall_ instantly changes the rate at which the targets fall to a mere 60 feet per round (equivalent to the end of a fall from a few feet), and the subjects take no damage upon landing while the spell is in effect. However, when the spell duration expires, a normal rate of falling resumes.

The spell affects one or more Medium or smaller creatures (including gear and carried objects up to each creature’s maximum load) or objects, or the equivalent in larger creatures: A Large creature or object counts as two Medium creatures or objects, a Huge creature or object counts as two Large creatures or objects, and so forth.

You can cast this spell with an instant utterance, quickly enough to save yourself if you unexpectedly fall. Casting the spell is a free action, like casting a quickened spell, and it counts toward the normal limit of one quickened spell per round. You may even cast this spell when it isn’t your turn.

This spell has no special effect on ranged weapons unless they are falling quite a distance. If the spell is cast on a falling item the object does half normal damage based on its weight, with no bonus for the height of the drop.

_Feather fall_ works only upon free-falling objects. It does not affect a sword blow or a charging or flying creature.

## Feeblemind

- **School:** Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]
- **Level:** Sorcerer 5, Wizard 5
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
- **Target:** One creature
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates; see text
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

If the target creature fails a Will saving throw, its Intelligence and Charisma scores each drop to 1. The affected creature is unable to use Intelligence- or Charisma-based skills, cast spells, understand language, or communicate coherently. Still, it knows who its friends are and can follow them and even protect them. The subject remains in this state until a _heal_, _limited wish_, _miracle_, or _wish_ spell is used to cancel the effect of the _feeblemind_. A creature that can cast arcane spells, such as a sorcerer or a wizard, takes a –4 penalty on its saving throw.

- **Material Component:** A handful of clay, crystal, glass, or mineral spheres.

## Fireball

- **School:** Evocation [Fire]
- **Level:** Sorcerer 3, Wizard 3
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
- **Area:** 20-ft.-radius spread
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw:** Reflex half
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

A _fireball_ spell is an explosion of flame that detonates with a low roar and deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to every creature within the area. Unattended objects also take this damage. The explosion creates almost no pressure.

You point your finger and determine the range (distance and height) at which the _fireball_ is to burst. A glowing, pea-sized bead streaks from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the _fireball_ at that point. (An early impact results in an early detonation.) If you attempt to send the bead through a narrow passage, such as through an arrow slit, you must “hit” the opening with a ranged touch attack, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely.

The _fireball_ sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with low melting points, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, and bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the _fireball_ may continue beyond the barrier if the area permits; otherwise it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.

- **Material Component:** A tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur.

## Flare

- **School:** Evocation [Light]
- **Level:** Bard 0, Druid 0, Sorcerer 0, Wizard 0
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
- **Effect:** Burst of light
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw:** Fortitude negates
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

This cantrip creates a burst of light. If you cause the light to burst directly in front of a single creature, that creature is dazzled for 1 minute unless it makes a successful Fortitude save. Sightless creatures, as well as creatures already dazzled, are not affected by _flare_.

## Fox’s Cunning

- **School:** Transmutation
- **Level:** Bard 2, Sorcerer 2, Wizard 2
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M/DF
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Target:** Creature touched
- **Duration:** 1 min./level
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

The transmuted creature becomes smarter. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Intelligence, adding the usual benefits to Intelligence-based skill checks and other uses of the Intelligence modifier. Wizards (and other spellcasters who rely on Intelligence) affected by this spell do not gain any additional bonus spells for the increased Intelligence, but the save DCs for spells they cast while under this spell’s effect do increase. This spell doesn’t grant extra skill points.

- **Arcane Material Component:** A few hairs, or a pinch of dung, from a fox.

## Ghost Sound

- **School:** Illusion (Figment)
- **Level:** Bard 0, Sorcerer 0, Wizard 0
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
- **Effect:** Illusory sounds
- **Duration:** 1 round/level (D)
- **Saving Throw:** Will disbelief (if interacted with)
- **Spell Resistance:** No

_Ghost sound_ allows you to create a volume of sound that rises, recedes, approaches, or remains at a fixed place. You choose what type of sound _ghost sound_ creates when casting it and cannot thereafter change the sound’s basic character.

The volume of sound created depends on your level. You can produce as much noise as four normal humans per caster level (maximum twenty humans). Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created. The noise a _ghost sound_ spell produces can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise from sixteen humans, while a roaring dire tiger is equal to the noise from twenty humans.

_Ghost sound_ can enhance the effectiveness of a _silent image_ spell.

_Ghost sound_ can be made permanent with a _permanency_ spell.

- **Material Component:** A bit of wool or a small lump of wax.

## Glitterdust

- **School:** Conjuration (Creation)
- **Level:** Bard 2, Sorcerer 2, Wizard 2
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
- **Area:** Creatures and objects within 10-ft.-radius spread
- **Duration:** 1 round/level
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates (blinding only)
- **Spell Resistance:** No

A cloud of golden particles covers everyone and everything in the area, causing creatures to become blinded and visibly outlining invisible things for the duration of the spell. All within the area are covered by the dust, which cannot be removed and continues to sparkle until it fades.

Any creature covered by the dust takes a –40 penalty on Hide checks.

- **Material Component:** Ground mica.

## Haste

- **School:** Transmutation
- **Level:** Bard 3, Sorcerer 3, Wizard 3
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
- **Target:** One creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart
- **Duration:** 1 round/level
- **Saving Throw:** Fortitude negates (harmless)
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)

The transmuted creatures move and act more quickly than normal. This extra speed has several effects.

When making a full attack action, a hasted creature may make one extra attack with any weapon he is holding. The attack is made using the creature’s full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers appropriate to the situation. (This effect is not cumulative with similar effects, such as that provided by a weapon of speed, nor does it actually grant an extra action, so you can’t use it to cast a second spell or otherwise take an extra action in the round.)

A _hasted_ creature gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves. Any condition that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also makes you lose dodge bonuses.

All of the _hasted_ creature’s modes of movement (including land movement, burrow, climb, fly, and swim) increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice the subject’s normal speed using that form of movement. This increase counts as an enhancement bonus, and it affects the creature’s jumping distance as normal for increased speed.

Multiple _haste_ effects don’t stack. _Haste_ dispels and counters _slow._

- **Material Component:** A shaving of licorice root.

The subject becomes paralyzed and freezes in place. It is aware and breathes normally but cannot take any actions, even speech. Each round on its turn, the subject may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect. (This is a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.)

A winged creature who is paralyzed cannot flap its wings and falls. A swimmer can’t swim and may drown.

- **Arcane Focus:** A small, straight piece of iron.

## Ice Storm

- **School:** Evocation [Cold]
- **Level:** Druid 4, Sorcerer 4, Wizard 4, Cleric 5

Great magical hailstones pound down for 1 full round, dealing 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 2d6 points of cold damage to every creature in the area. A –4 penalty applies to each Listen check made within the _ice storm_’s effect, and all land movement within its area is at half speed. At the end of the duration, the hail disappears, leaving no aftereffects (other than the damage dealt).

- **Arcane Material Component:** A pinch of dust and a few drops of water.

## Identify

- **Target:** One touched object
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

## Interposing Hand

- **School:** Evocation [Force]
- **Level:** Sorcerer 5, Wizard 5
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, F
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
- **Effect:** 10-ft. hand
- **Duration:** 1 round/level (D)
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

_Interposing hand_ creates a Large magic hand that appears between you and one opponent. This floating, disembodied hand then moves to remain between the two of you, regardless of where you move or how the opponent tries to get around it, providing cover (+4 AC) for you against that opponent. Nothing can fool the hand—it sticks with the selected opponent in spite of darkness, invisibility, polymorphing, or any other attempt at hiding or disguise. The hand does not pursue an opponent, however.

An _interposing hand_ is 10 feet long and about that wide with its fingers outstretched. It has as many hit points as you do when you’re undamaged, and its AC is 20 (–1 size, +11 natural). It takes damage as a normal creature, but most magical effects that don’t cause damage do not affect it.

The hand never provokes attacks of opportunity from opponents. It cannot push through a _wall of force_ or enter an _antimagic field_, but it suffers the full effect of a _prismatic wall_ or _prismatic sphere._ The hand makes saving throws as its caster.

_Disintegrate_ or a successful _dispel magic_ destroys it.

Any creature weighing 2,000 pounds or less that tries to push past the hand is slowed to half its normal speed. The hand cannot reduce the speed of a creature weighing more than 2,000 pounds, but it still affects the creature’s attacks.

Directing the spell to a new target is a move action.

- **Focus:** A soft glove.

## Invisibility

- **School:** Illusion (Glamer)
- **Level:** Bard 2, Sorcerer 2, Wizard 2, Cleric 2
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M/DF
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Personal or touch
- **Target:** You or a creature or object weighing no more than 100 lb./level
- **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless) or Will negates (harmless, object)
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless) or Yes (harmless, object)

The creature or object touched becomes invisible, vanishing from sight, even from darkvision. If the recipient is a creature carrying gear, that vanishes, too. If you cast the spell on someone else, neither you nor your allies can see the subject, unless you can normally see invisible things or you employ magic to do so.

Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source). Any part of an item that the subject carries but that extends more than 10 feet from it becomes visible.

Of course, the subject is not magically _silenced,_ and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as stepping in a puddle). The spell ends if the subject attacks any creature. For purposes of this spell, an attack includes any spell targeting a foe or whose area or effect includes a foe. (Exactly who is a foe depends on the invisible character’s perceptions.) Actions directed at unattended objects do not break the spell. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, summon monsters and have them attack, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a portcullis to release attack dogs, and so forth. If the subject attacks directly, however, it immediately becomes visible along with all its gear. Spells such as _bless_ that specifically affect allies but not foes are not attacks for this purpose, even when they include foes in their area.

_Invisibility_ can be made permanent (on objects only) with a _permanency_ spell.

- **Arcane Material Component:** An eyelash encased in a bit of gum arabic.

- **Range:**

## Legend Lore

- **School:** Divination
- **Level:** Bard 4, Cleric 7, Sorcerer 6, Wizard 6
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M, F
- **Casting Time:** See text
- **Range:** Personal
- **Target:** You
- **Duration:** See text

_Legend lore_ brings to your mind legends about an important person, place, or thing. If the person or thing is at hand, or if you are in the place in question, the casting time is only 1d4x10 minutes. If you have only detailed information on the person, place, or thing, the casting time is 1d10 days, and the resulting lore is less complete and specific (though it often provides enough information to help you find the person, place, or thing, thus allowing a better _legend lore_ result next time). If you know only rumors, the casting time is 2d6 weeks, and the resulting lore is vague and incomplete (though it often directs you to more detailed information, thus allowing a better _legend lore_ result next time).

During the casting, you cannot engage in other than routine activities: eating, sleeping, and so forth. When completed, the divination brings legends (if any) about the person, place, or things to your mind. These may be legends that are still current, legends that have been forgotten, or even information that has never been generally known. If the person, place, or thing is not of legendary importance, you gain no information. As a rule of thumb, characters who are 11th level and higher are “legendary,” as are the sorts of creatures they contend with, the major magic items they wield, and the places where they perform their key deeds.

- **Material Component:** Incense worth at least 250 gp.

## Light

- **School:** Evocation [Light]

- **Range:** Touch
- **Target:** Object touched
- **Duration:** 10 min./level (D)
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No

This spell causes an object to glow like a torch, shedding bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light for an additional 20 feet) from the point you touch. The effect is immobile, but it can be cast on a movable object. Light taken into an area of magical _darkness_ does not function.

A light spell (one with the light descriptor) counters and dispels a darkness spell (one with the darkness descriptor) of an equal or lower level.

- **Arcane Material Component:** A firefly or a piece of phosphorescent moss.

## Lightning Bolt

- **School:** Evocation [Electricity]
- **Level:** Sorcerer 3, Wizard 3

You release a powerful stroke of electrical energy that deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to each creature within its area. The bolt begins at your fingertips.

The _lightning bolt_ sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in its path. It can melt metals with a low melting point, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, or bronze. If the damage caused to an interposing barrier shatters or breaks through it, the bolt may continue beyond the barrier if the spell’s range permits; otherwise, it stops at the barrier just as any other spell effect does.

## Mage Armor

An invisible but tangible field of force surrounds the subject of a _mage armor_ spell, providing a +4 armor bonus to AC.

Unlike mundane armor, _mage armor_ entails no armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, or speed reduction. Since _mage armor_ is made of force, incorporeal creatures can’t bypass it the way they do normal armor.

_Focus_: A piece of cured leather.

You point your finger at an object and can lift it and move it at will from a distance. As a move action, you can propel the object as far as 15 feet in any direction, though the spell ends if the distance between you and the object ever exceeds the spell’s range.

## Magic Circle Against Evil

- **School:** Abjuration [Good]
- **Level:** Cleric 3, Paladin 3, Sorcerer 3, Wizard 3
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M/DF
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Area:** 10-ft.-radius emanation from touched creature
- **Duration:** 10 min./level
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
- **Spell Resistance:** No; see text

All creatures within the area gain the effects of a _protection from evil_ spell, and no nongood summoned creatures can enter the area either. You must overcome a creature’s spell resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of _protection from evil_), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies’ spell resistance.

This spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it. A _magic circle against evil_ can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the _lesser planar binding, planar binding,_ and _greater planar binding_ spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the _magic circle_. The creature cannot cross the circle’s boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell’s area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal _protection from evil_ spell for that creature only.

A _magic circle_ leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle. A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (_astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport,_ and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through that means. You can prevent the creature’s extradimensional escape by casting a _dimensional anchor_ spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the _anchor_ effect lasts as long as the _magic circle_ does. The creature cannot reach across the _magic circle,_ but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.

You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the _magic circle_ more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task. This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.

A successful diagram allows you to cast a _dimensional anchor_ spell on the _magic circle_ during the round before casting any summoning spell. The _anchor_ holds any called creatures in the _magic circle_ for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a _magic circle_ prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the _lesser planar binding_ spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram—even a straw laid across it. However, the creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above.

This spell is not cumulative with _protection from evil_ and vice versa.

- **Arcane Material Component:** A little powdered silver with which you trace a 3-footdiameter circle on the floor (or ground) around the creature to be warded.

## Magic Missile

- **School:** Evocation [Force]
- **Level:** Sorcerer 1, Wizard 1
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
- **Target:** Up to five creatures, no two of which can be more than 15 ft. apart
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

A missile of magical energy darts forth from your fingertip and strikes its target, dealing 1d4+1 points of force damage.

The missile strikes unerringly, even if the target is in melee combat or has less than total cover or total concealment. Specific parts of a creature can’t be singled out. Inanimate objects are not damaged by the spell.

For every two caster levels beyond 1st, you gain an additional missile—two at 3rd level, three at 5th, four at 7th, and the maximum of five missiles at 9th level or higher. If you shoot multiple missiles, you can have them strike a single creature or several creatures. A single missile can strike only one creature. You must designate targets before you check for spell resistance or roll damage.

## Mending

- **School:** Transmutation
- **Level:** Bard 0, Cleric 0, Druid 0, Sorcerer 0, Wizard 0
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** 10 ft.
- **Target:** One object of up to 1 lb.
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless, object)
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless, object)

_Mending_ repairs small breaks or tears in objects (but not warps, such as might be caused by a _warp wood_ spell). It will weld broken metallic objects such as a ring, a chain link, a medallion, or a slender dagger, providing but one break exists.

Ceramic or wooden objects with multiple breaks can be invisibly rejoined to be as strong as new. A hole in a leather sack or a wineskin is completely healed over by _mending._ The spell can repair a magic item, but the item’s magical abilities are not restored. The spell cannot mend broken magic rods, staffs, or wands, nor does it affect creatures (including constructs).

## Message

- **School:** Transmutation [Language-Dependent]
- **Level:** Bard 0, Sorcerer 0, Wizard 0
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, F
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
- **Target:** One creature/level
- **Duration:** 10 min./level
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No

You can whisper messages and receive whispered replies with little chance of being overheard. You point your finger at each creature you want to receive the message. When you whisper, the whispered message is audible to all targeted creatures within range. Magical _silence,_ 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal (or a thin sheet of lead), or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks the spell. The message does not have to travel in a straight line. It can circumvent a barrier if there is an open path between you and the subject, and the path’s entire length lies within the spell’s range. The creatures that receive the message can whisper a reply that you hear. The spell transmits sound, not meaning. It doesn’t transcend language barriers.

_Note:_ To speak a message, you must mouth the words and whisper, possibly allowing observers the opportunity to read your lips.

_Focus_: A short piece of copper wire.

## Mirror Image

- **School:** Illusion (Figment)
- **Level:** Bard 2, Sorcerer 2, Wizard 2
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Personal; see text
- **Target:** You
- **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)

Several illusory duplicates of you pop into being, making it difficult for enemies to know which target to attack. The figments stay near you and disappear when struck.

_Mirror image_ creates 1d4 images plus one image per three caster levels (maximum eight images total). These figments separate from you and remain in a cluster, each within 5 feet of at least one other figment or you. You can move into and through a _mirror image._ When you and the _mirror image_ separate, observers can’t use vision or hearing to tell which one is you and which the image. The figments may also move through each other. The figments mimic your actions, pretending to cast spells when you cast a spell, drink potions when you drink a potion, levitate when you levitate, and so on.

Enemies attempting to attack you or cast spells at you must select from among indistinguishable targets. Generally, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment. Any successful attack against an image destroys it. An image’s AC is 10 + your size modifier + your Dex modifier. Figments seem to react normally to area spells (such as looking like they’re burned or dead after being hit by a _fireball_).

While moving, you can merge with and split off from figments so that enemies who have learned which image is real are again confounded.

An attacker must be able to see the images to be fooled. If you are invisible or an attacker shuts his or her eyes, the spell has no effect. (Being unable to see carries the same penalties as being blinded.)

## Misdirection

- **School:** Illusion (Glamer)
- **Level:** Bard 2, Sorcerer 2, Wizard 2
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
- **Target:** One creature or object, up to a 10-ft. cube in size
- **Duration:** 1 hour/level
- **Saving Throw:** None or Will negates; see text
- **Spell Resistance:** No

By means of this spell, you misdirect the information from divination spells that reveal auras (_detect evil, detect magic, discern lies,_ and the like). On casting the spell, you choose another object within range. For the duration of the spell, the subject of _misdirection_ is detected as if it were the other object. (Neither the subject nor the other object gets a saving throw against this effect.) Detection spells provide information based on the second object rather than on the actual target of the detection unless the caster of the detection succeeds on a Will save. For instance, you could make yourself detect as a tree if one were within range at casting: not evil, not lying, not magical, neutral in alignment, and so forth. This spell does not affect other types of divination magic (_augury, detect thoughts, clairaudience/clairvoyance,_ and the like).

- **Duration:** 2 hours/level (D)
- **Saving Throw:** None

## Nondetection

- **School:** Abjuration
- **Level:** Ranger 4, Sorcerer 3, Wizard 3, Cleric 3
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Target:** Creature or object touched
- **Duration:** 1 hour/level
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless, object)
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless, object)

The warded creature or object becomes difficult to detect by divination spells such as _clairaudience/clairvoyance, locate object,_ and _detect_ spells. _Nondetection_ also prevents location by such magic items as _crystal balls._If a divination is attempted against the warded creature or item, the caster of the divination must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the spellcaster who cast _nondetection_. If you cast _nondetection_ on yourself or on an item currently in your possession, the DC is 15 + your caster level.

If cast on a creature, _nondetection_ wards the creature’s gear as well as the creature itself.

- **Material Component:** A pinch of diamond dust worth 50 gp.

## Obscuring Mist

- **School:** Conjuration (Creation)
- **Level:** Cleric 1, Druid 1, Sorcerer 1, Wizard 1
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** 20 ft.
- **Effect:** Cloud spreads in 20-ft. radius from you, 20 ft. high
- **Duration:** 1 min./level
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No

A misty vapor arises around you. It is stationary once created. The vapor obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target).

A moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a _gust of wind_ spell, disperses the fog in 4 rounds. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round. A _fireball, flame strike_, or similar spell burns away the fog in the explosive or fiery spell’s area. A _wall of fire_ burns away the fog in the area into which it deals damage.

This spell does not function underwater.

## Open/Close

- **School:** Transmutation
- **Level:** Bard 0, Sorcerer 0, Wizard 0
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, F
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
- **Target:** Object weighing up to 30 lb. or portal that can be opened or closed
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates (object)
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes (object)

You can open or close (your choice) a door, chest, box, window, bag, pouch, bottle, barrel, or other container. If anything resists this activity (such as a bar on a door or a lock on a chest), the spell fails. In addition, the spell can only open and close things weighing 30 pounds or less. Thus, doors, chests, and similar objects sized for enormous creatures may be beyond this spell’s ability to affect.

_Focus_: A brass key.

## Prestidigitation

- **School:** Universal
- **Level:** Bard 0, Sorcerer 0, Wizard 0
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** 10 ft.
- **Duration:** 1 hour
- **Saving Throw:** See text
- **Spell Resistance:** No

Prestidigitations are minor tricks that novice spellcasters use for practice. Once cast, a _prestidigitation_ spell enables you to perform simple magical effects for 1 hour. The effects are minor and have severe limitations. A prestidigitation can slowly lift 1 pound of material. It can color, clean, or soil items in a 1-foot cube each round. It can chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material. It cannot deal damage or affect the concentration of spellcasters. _Prestidigitation_ can create small objects, but they look crude and artificial. The materials created by a _prestidigitation_ spell are extremely fragile, and they cannot be used as tools, weapons, or spell components. Finally, a _prestidigitation_ lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects. Any actual change to an object (beyond just moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists only 1 hour.

## Protection From Arrows

- **School:** Abjuration
- **Level:** Sorcerer 2, Wizard 2
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, F
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Target:** Creature touched
- **Duration:** 1 hour/level or until discharged
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)

The warded creature gains resistance to ranged weapons. The subject gains damage reduction 10/magic against ranged weapons. (This spell doesn’t grant you the ability to damage creatures with similar damage reduction.) Once the spell has prevented a total of 10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 100 points), it is discharged.

- **Focus:** A piece of shell from a tortoise or a turtle.

## Protection From Energy

- **School:** Abjuration
- **Level:** Cleric 3, Druid 3, Ranger 2, Sorcerer 3, Wizard 3
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, DF
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Target:** Creature touched
- **Duration:** 10 min./level or until discharged
- **Saving Throw:** Fortitude negates (harmless)
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)

_Protection from energy_ grants temporary immunity to the type of energy you specify when you cast it (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic). When the spell absorbs 12 points per caster level of energy damage (to a maximum of 120 points at 10th level), it is discharged.

_Note: Protection from energy_ overlaps (and does not stack with) _resist energy._ If a character is warded by _protection from energy_ and _resist energy,_ the _protection_ spell absorbs damage until its power is exhausted.

## Protection From Evil

- **School:** Abjuration [Good]
- **Level:** Cleric 1, Paladin 1, Sorcerer 1, Wizard 1
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M/DF
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Target:** Creature touched
- **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
- **Spell Resistance:** No; see text

This spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures, from mental control, and from summoned creatures. It creates a magical barrier around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the subject and has three major effects.

First, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures.

Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by a _magic jar_ attack, for example) or to exercise mental control over the creature (including enchantment (charm) effects and enchantment (compulsion) effects that grant the caster ongoing control over the subject, such as _dominate person_). The protection does not prevent such effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the effect for the duration of the _protection from evil_ effect. If the _protection from evil_ effect ends before the effect granting mental control does, the would-be controller would then be able to mentally command the controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is cast. This second effect works regardless of alignment.

Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Good summoned creatures are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.

- **Arcane Material Component:** A little powdered silver with which you trace a 3-foot -diameter circle on the floor (or ground) around the creature to be warded.

- **Target:** One willing living creature per three levels, no two of which may be more than 30 ft. apart
- **Duration:** Concentration + 1 round/level (D)
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

Each affected creature gains a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution, a +1 morale bonus on Will saves, and a –2 penalty to AC. The effect is otherwise identical with a barbarian’s rage except that the subjects aren’t fatigued at the end of the rage.

- **Effect:** Ray
- **Duration:** 1 min./level
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

A coruscating ray springs from your hand. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to strike a target. The subject takes a penalty to Strength equal to 1d6+1 per two caster levels (maximum 1d6+5). The subject’s Strength score cannot drop below 1.

## Read Magic

- **School:** Divination
- **Level:** Bard 0, Cleric 0, Druid 0, Paladin 1, Ranger 1, Sorcerer 0, Wizard 0
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, F
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Personal
- **Target:** You
- **Duration:** 10 min./level

By means of _read magic,_ you can decipher magical inscriptions on objects—books, scrolls, weapons, and the like—that would otherwise be unintelligible. This deciphering does not normally invoke the magic contained in the writing, although it may do so in the case of a cursed scroll. Furthermore, once the spell is cast and you have read the magical inscription, you are thereafter able to read that particular writing without recourse to the use of _read magic._ You can read at the rate of one page (250 words) per minute. The spell allows you to identify a _glyph of warding_ with a DC 13 Spellcraft check, a _greater glyph of warding_ with a DC 16 Spellcraft check, or any _symbol_ spell with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + spell level).

_Read magic_ can be made permanent with a _permanency_ spell.

- **Focus:** A clear crystal or mineral prism.

- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Target:** Creature touched
- **Duration:** 1 minute
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)

You imbue the subject with magical energy that protects it from harm, granting it a +1 resistance bonus on saves.

_Resistance_ can be made permanent with a _permanency_ spell.

- **Arcane Material Component:** A miniature cloak.

## Rope Trick

- **School:** Transmutation
- **Level:** Sorcerer 2, Wizard 2
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Target:** One touched piece of rope from 5 ft. to 30 ft. long
- **Duration:** 1 hour/level (D)
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No

When this spell is cast upon a piece of rope from 5 to 30 feet long, one end of the rope rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to the ground, as if affixed at the upper end. The upper end is, in fact, fastened to an extradimensional space that is outside the multiverse of extradimensional spaces (“planes”). Creatures in the extradimensional space are hidden, beyond the reach of spells (including divinations), unless those spells work across planes. The space holds as many as eight creatures (of any size). Creatures in the space can pull the rope up into the space, making the rope “disappear.” In that case, the rope counts as one of the eight creatures that can fit in the space. The rope can support up to 16,000 pounds. A weight greater than that can pull the rope free.

Spells cannot be cast across the extradimensional interface, nor can area effects cross it. Those in the extradimensional space can see out of it as if a 3-foot-by- 5-foot window were centered on the rope. The window is present on the Material Plane, but it’s invisible, and even creatures that can see the window can’t see through it. Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends. The rope can be climbed by only one person at a time. The _rope trick_ spell enables climbers to reach a normal place if they do not climb all the way to the extradimensional space.

_Note:_ It is hazardous to create an extradimensional space within an existing extradimensional space or to take an extradimensional space into an existing one.

## See Invisibility

- **School:** Divination
- **Level:** Bard 3, Sorcerer 2, Wizard 2
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Personal
- **Target:** You
- **Duration:** 10 min./level (D)

You can see any objects or beings that are invisible within your range of vision, as well as any that are ethereal, as if they were normally visible. Such creatures are visible to you as translucent shapes, allowing you easily to discern the difference between visible, invisible, and ethereal creatures.

The spell does not reveal the method used to obtain invisibility. It does not reveal illusions or enable you to see through opaque objects. It does not reveal creatures who are simply hiding, concealed, or otherwise hard to see.

_See invisibility_ can be made permanent with a _permanency_ spell.

- **Material Component:** A pinch of talc and a small sprinkling of powdered silver.

## Sending

- **School:** Evocation
- **Level:** Cleric 4, Sorcerer 5, Wizard 5
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M/DF
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** See text
- **Target:** One creature
- **Duration:** 1 round; see text
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No

You contact a particular creature with which you are familiar and send a short message of twenty-five words or less to the subject. The subject recognizes you if it knows you. It can answer in like manner immediately. A creature with an Intelligence score as low as 1 can understand the _sending,_ though the subject’s ability to react is limited as normal by its Intelligence score. Even if the _sending_ is received, the subject is not obligated to act upon it in any manner.

If the creature in question is not on the same plane of existence as you are, there is a 5% chance that the _sending_ does not arrive. (Local conditions on other planes may worsen this chance considerably.)

- **Arcane Material Component:** A short piece of fine copper wire.

## Shadow Walk

- **School:** Illusion (Shadow)
- **Level:** Bard 5, Sorcerer 6, Wizard 6
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Target:** Up to one touched creature/ level
- **Duration:** 1 hour/level (D)
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

To use the _shadow walk_ spell, you must be in an area of shadowy illumination. You and any creature you touch are then transported along a coiling path of shadowstuff to the edge of the Material Plane where it borders the Plane of Shadow. The effect is largely illusory, but the path is quasi-real. You can take more than one creature along with you (subject to your level limit), but all must be touching each other.

In the region of shadow, you move at a rate of 50 miles per hour, moving normally on the borders of the Plane of Shadow but much more rapidly relative to the Material Plane. Thus, you can use this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto the Plane of Shadow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto the Material Plane.

Because of the blurring of reality between the Plane of Shadow and the Material Plane, you can’t make out details of the terrain or areas you pass over during transit, nor can you predict perfectly where your travel will end. It’s impossible to judge distances accurately, making the spell virtually useless for scouting or spying. Furthermore, when the spell effect ends, you are shunted 1d10x100 feet in a random horizontal direction from your desired endpoint. If this would place you within a solid object, you are shunted 1d10x1,000 feet in the same direction. If this would still place you within a solid object, you (and any creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty space available, but the strain of this activity renders each creature fatigued (no save).

_Shadow walk_ can also be used to travel to other planes that border on the Plane of Shadow, but this usage requires the transit of the Plane of Shadow to arrive at a border with another plane of reality. The transit of the Plane of Shadow requires 1d4 hours.

Any creatures touched by you when _shadow walk_ is cast also make the transition to the borders of the Plane of Shadow.

They may opt to follow you, wander off through the plane, or stumble back into the Material Plane (50% chance for either of the latter results if they are lost or abandoned by you). Creatures unwilling to accompany you into the Plane of Shadow receive a Will saving throw, negating the effect if successful.

## Shield

- **School:** Abjuration [Force]
- **Level:** Sorcerer 1, Wizard 1
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Personal
- **Target:** You
- **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)

_Shield_ creates an invisible, tower shield-sized mobile disk of force that hovers in front of you. It negates _magic missile_ attacks directed at you. The disk also provides a +4 shield bonus to AC. This bonus applies against incorporeal touch attacks, since it is a force effect. The _shield_ has no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure chance. Unlike with a normal tower shield, you can’t use the _shield_ spell for cover.

## Shout

- **School:** Evocation [Sonic]
- **Level:** Bard 4, Sorcerer 4, Wizard 4
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** 30 ft.
- **Area:** Cone-shaped burst
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw:** Fortitude partial or Reflex negates (object); see text
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes (object)

You emit an ear-splitting yell that deafens and damages creatures in its path. Any creature within the area is deafened for 2d6 rounds and takes 5d6 points of sonic damage. A successful save negates the deafness and reduces the damage by half. Any exposed brittle or crystalline object or crystalline creature takes 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). An affected creature is allowed a Fortitude save to reduce the damage by half, and a creature holding fragile objects can negate damage to them with a successful Reflex save.

A _shout_ spell cannot penetrate a _silence_ spell.

## Sleep

- **School:** Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]
- **Level:** Bard 1, Sorcerer 1, Wizard 1
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M
- **Casting Time:** 1 round
- **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
- **Area:** One or more living creatures within a 10-ft.-radius burst
- **Duration:** 1 min./level
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

A _sleep_ spell causes a magical slumber to come upon 4 Hit Dice of creatures. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first.

Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell’s point of origin are affected first. Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted.

Sleeping creatures are helpless. Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not. Awakening a creature is a standard action (an application of the aid another action).

_Sleep_ does not target unconscious creatures, constructs, or undead creatures.

- **Material Component:** A pinch of fine sand, rose petals, or a live cricket.

## Solid Fog

- **School:** Conjuration (Creation)
- **Level:** Sorcerer 4, Wizard 4
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M
- **Casting Time:** 
- **Range:** 
- **Duration:** 1 min./level
- **Spell Resistance:** No

This spell functions like _fog cloud_, but in addition to obscuring sight, the _solid fog_ is so thick that any creature attempting to move through it progresses at a speed of 5 feet, regardless of its normal speed, and it takes a –2 penalty on all melee attack and melee damage rolls. The vapors prevent effective ranged weapon attacks (except for magic rays and the like). A creature or object that falls into _solid fog_ is slowed, so that each 10 feet of vapor that it passes through reduces falling damage by 1d6. A creature can’t take a 5-foot step while in _solid fog._

However, unlike normal fog, only a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses these vapors, and it does so in 1 round.

_Solid fog_ can be made permanent with a _permanency_ spell. A permanent _solid fog_ dispersed by wind reforms in 10 minutes.

- **Material Component:** A pinch of dried, powdered peas combined with powdered animal hoof.

## Spider Climb

- **School:** Transmutation
- **Level:** Druid 2, Sorcerer 2, Wizard 2
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Target:** Creature touched
- **Duration:** 10 min./level
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)

The subject can climb and travel on vertical surfaces or even traverse ceilings as well as a spider does. The affected creature must have its hands free to climb in this manner. The subject gains a climb speed of 20 feet; furthermore, it need not make Climb checks to traverse a vertical or horizontal surface (even upside down). A _spider climbing_ creature retains its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus to their attacks against it. It cannot, however, use the run action while climbing.

- **Material Component:** A drop of bitumen and a live spider, both of which must be eaten by the subject.

## Stoneskin

- **School:** Abjuration

The warded creature gains resistance to blows, cuts, stabs, and slashes. The subject gains damage reduction 10/adamantine. (It ignores the first 10 points of damage each time it takes damage from a weapon, though an adamantine weapon bypasses the reduction.) Once the spell has prevented a total of 10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 150 points), it is discharged.

- **Material Component:** Granite and 250 gp worth of diamond dust sprinkled on the target’s skin.

## Teleport

- **School:** Conjuration (Teleportation)
- **Level:** Sorcerer 5, Wizard 5, Cleric 5
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Personal and touch
- **Target:** You and touched objects or other touched willing creatures
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw:** None and Will negates (object)
- **Spell Resistance:** No and Yes (object)

This spell instantly transports you to a designated destination, which may be as distant as 100 miles per caster level. Interplanar travel is not possible. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn’t exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent (see below) per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you. As with all spells where the range is personal and the target is you, you need not make a saving throw, nor is spell resistance applicable to you. Only objects held or in use (attended) by another person receive saving throws and spell resistance.

You must have some clear idea of the location and layout of the destination. The clearer your mental image, the more likely the teleportation works. Areas of strong physical or magical energy may make teleportation more hazardous or even impossible.

To see how well the teleportation works, roll d% and consult the Teleport table. Refer to the following information for definitions of the terms on the table.

_Familiarity:_ “Very familiar” is a place where you have been very often and where you feel at home. “Studied carefully” is a place you know well, either because you can currently see it, you’ve been there often, or you have used other means (such as _scrying_) to study the place for at least one hour. “Seen casually” is a place that you have seen more than once but with which you are not very familiar. “Viewed once” is a place that you have seen once, possibly using magic.

“False destination” is a place that does not truly exist or if you are teleporting to an otherwise familiar location that no longer exists as such or has been so completely altered as to no longer be familiar to you. When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.

_On Target:_ You appear where you want to be.

_Off Target:_ You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10x1d10% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly

_Similar Area:_ You wind up in an area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area.

Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range. If no such area exists within the spell’s range, the spell simply fails instead.

_Mishap:_ You and anyone else teleporting with you have gotten “scrambled.” You each take 1d10 points of damage, and you reroll on the chart to see where you wind up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20+80. Each time “Mishap” comes up, the characters take more damage and must reroll.

| Familiarity                 | On Target | Off Target | Similar Area | Mishap |
| --------------------------- | --------- | ---------- | ------------ | ------ |
| Very familiar               | 01–97     | 98–99      | 100          | —      |
| Studied carefully           | 01–94     | 95–97      | 98–99        | 100    |
| Seen casually               | 01–88     | 89–94      | 95–98        | 99–100 |
| Viewed once                 | 01–76     | 77–88      | 89–96        | 97–100 |
| False destination (1d20+80) | —         | —          | 81–92        | 93–100 |

## Touch of Fatigue

- **School:** Necromancy
- **Level:** Sorcerer 0, Wizard 0
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Target:** Creature touched
- **Duration:** 1 round/level
- **Saving Throw:** Fortitude negates
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

You channel negative energy through your touch, fatiguing the target. You must succeed on a touch attack to strike a target.

The subject is immediately fatigued for the spell’s duration.

This spell has no effect on a creature that is already fatigued. Unlike with normal fatigue, the effect ends as soon as the spell’s duration expires.

- **Material Component:** A drop of sweat.

## Transmute Rock to Mud

- **School:** Transmutation [Earth]
- **Level:** Druid 5, Sorcerer 5, Wizard 5
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M/DF
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
- **Area:** Up to two 10-ft. cubes/level (S)
- **Duration:** Permanent; see text
- **Saving Throw:** See text
- **Spell Resistance:** No

This spell turns natural, uncut or unworked rock of any sort into an equal volume of mud. Magical stone is not affected by the spell. The depth of the mud created cannot exceed 10 feet. A creature unable to levitate, fly, or otherwise free itself from the mud sinks until hip- or chest-deep, reducing its speed to 5 feet and causing a –2 penalty on attack rolls and AC. Brush thrown atop the mud can support creatures able to climb on top of it. Creatures large enough to walk on the bottom can wade through the area at a speed of 5 feet.

If _transmute rock to mud_ is cast upon the ceiling of a cavern or tunnel, the mud falls to the floor and spreads out in a pool at a depth of 5 feet. The falling mud and the ensuing cave-in deal 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to anyone caught directly beneath the area, or half damage to those who succeed on Reflex saves.

Castles and large stone buildings are generally immune to the effect of the spell, since _transmute rock to mud_ can’t affect worked stone and doesn’t reach deep enough to undermine such buildings’ foundations. However, small buildings or structures often rest upon foundations shallow enough to be damaged or even partially toppled by this spell.

The mud remains until a successful _dispel magic_ or _transmute mud to rock_ spell restores its substance—but not necessarily its form. Evaporation turns the mud to normal dirt over a period of days. The exact time depends on exposure to the sun, wind, and normal drainage.

- **Arcane Material Component:** Clay and water.

## Wall of Ice

- **School:** Evocation [Cold]
- **Level:** Sorcerer 4, Wizard 4
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
- **Effect:** Anchored plane of ice, up to one 10-ft. square/level, or hemisphere of ice with a radius of up to 3 ft. + 1 ft./level
- **Duration:** 1 min./level
- **Saving Throw:** Reflex negates; see text
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

This spell creates an anchored plane of ice or a hemisphere of ice, depending on the version selected. A _wall of ice_ cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. Any creature adjacent to the wall when it is created may attempt a Reflex save to disrupt the wall as it is being formed. A successful save indicates that the spell automatically fails. Fire can melt a _wall of ice,_ and it deals full damage to the wall (instead of the normal half damage taken by objects). Suddenly melting a _wall of ice_ creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes.

_Ice Plane:_ A sheet of strong, hard ice appears. The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level. It covers up to a 10-foot-square area per caster level (so a 10th-level wizard can create a wall of ice 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, or some other combination of length and height that does not exceed 1,000 square feet). The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored. A vertical wall need only be anchored on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides.

Each 10-foot square of wall has 3 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the wall automatically. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + caster level.

Even when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains. Any creature stepping through it (including the one who broke through the wall) takes 1d6 points of cold damage +1 point per caster level (no save).

_Hemisphere:_ The wall takes the form of a hemisphere whose maximum radius is 3 feet + 1 foot per caster level. The _hemisphere_ is as hard to break through as the _ice plane_ form, but it does not deal damage to those who go through a breach.

- **Material Component:** A small piece of quartz or similar rock crystal.

## Web

- **School:** Conjuration (Creation)
- **Level:** Sorcerer 2, Wizard 2
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
- **Effect:** Webs in a 20-ft.-radius spread
- **Duration:** 10 min./level (D)
- **Saving Throw:** Reflex negates; see text
- **Spell Resistance:** No

_Web_ creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands. These strands trap those caught in them. The strands are similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher. These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points or else the web collapses upon itself and disappears. Creatures caught within a _web_ become entangled among the gluey fibers. Attacking a creature in a web won’t cause you to become entangled.

Anyone in the effect’s area when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save. If this save succeeds, the creature is entangled, but not prevented from moving, though moving is more difficult than normal for being entangled (see below). If the save fails, the creature is entangled and can’t move from its space, but can break loose by spending 1 round and making a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 25 Escape Artist check. Once loose (either by making the initial Reflex save or a later Strength check or Escape Artist check), a creature remains entangled, but may move through the _web_ very slowly. Each round devoted to moving allows the creature to make a new Strength check or Escape Artist check. The creature moves 5 feet for each full 5 points by which the check result exceeds 10.

If you have at least 5 feet of web between you and an opponent, it provides cover. If you have at least 20 feet of web between you, it provides total cover.

The strands of a _web_ spell are flammable. A magic _flaming sword_ can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. Any fire can set the webs alight and burn away 5 square feet in 1 round. All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of fire damage from the flames.

_Web_ can be made permanent with a _permanency_ spell. A permanent _web_ that is damaged (but not destroyed) regrows in 10 minutes.

- **Material Component:** A bit of spider web.

## Whispering Wind

- **School:** Transmutation [Air]
- **Level:** Bard 2, Sorcerer 2, Wizard 2
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** 1 mile/level
- **Area:** 10-ft.-radius spread
- **Duration:** No more than 1 hour/level or until discharged (destination is reached)
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No

You send a message or sound on the wind to a designated spot. The _whispering wind_ travels to a specific location within range that is familiar to you, provided that it can find a way to the location. A _whispering wind_ is as gentle and unnoticed as a zephyr until it reaches the location. It then delivers its whisper-quiet message or other sound. Note that the message is delivered regardless of whether anyone is present to hear it. The wind then dissipates.

You can prepare the spell to bear a message of no more than twenty-five words, cause the spell to deliver other sounds for 1 round, or merely have the _whispering wind_ seem to be a faint stirring of the air. You can likewise cause the _whispering wind_ to move as slowly as 1 mile per hour or as quickly as 1 mile per 10 minutes.

When the spell reaches its objective, it swirls and remains in place until the message is delivered. As with _magic mouth, whispering wind_ cannot speak verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects.
