## Avoid Planar Effects

- **School:** Abjuration
- **Level:** Cleric 2, Druid 2, Sorcerer 3, Wizard 3
- **Source:** Spell Compendium (SC) Spells
- **Components:** V
- **Casting Time:** 1 immediate action
- **Range:** 20 ft.
- **Target:** One creature/level in a 20-ft.-radius burst centered on you
- **Duration:** 1 minute/level
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)

The danger of the plane surprises you, and you have barely time to bark out a few elder words of power. In a moment you’re safe, and you gain a brief respite—time enough to cast more permanent protective spells. You gain a temporary respite from the natural effects of a specific plane. These effects include extremes in temperature, lack of air, poisonous fumes, emanations of positive or negative energy, or other attributes of the plane itself (DMG 150).

Avoid planar effects provides protection from the 3d10 points of fire damage that characters normally take when on a plane with the fire-dominant trait. Avoid planar effects allows a character to breathe water on a waterdominant plane and ignore the threat of suffocation on an earth-dominant plane. A character protected by avoid planar effects can’t be blinded by the energy of a major positive-dominant plane and automatically stops gaining temporary hit points when they equal the character’s full normal hit point total. Negative-dominant planes don’t deal damage or bestow negative levels to characters protected by avoid planar effects.

In addition, some effects specific to a plane are negated by avoid planar effects. In the D&D cosmology, avoid planar effects negates the deafening effect of Pandemonium and the cold damage on the Cania layer of the Nine Hells. The DM can add additional protections for a cosmology he creates. If the campaign has an Elemental Plane of Cold, for example, avoid planar effects protects against the base cold damage dealt to everyone on the plane.

The effects of gravity traits, alignment traits, and magic traits aren’t negated by avoid planar effects, nor is the special entrapping trait of certain planes (such as Elysium and Hades).

The spell does not provide protection against creatures, native or otherwise, nor does it protect against spells, special abilities, or extreme and nonnatural formations within the plane. This spell allows you to survive on the Elemental Plane of Earth, for instance, but it won’t protect you if you walk into a pool of magma on that same plane.

## Blade Barrier

- **School:** Evocation [Force]
- **Level:** Cleric 6
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
- **Effect:** Wall of whirling blades up to 20 ft. long/ level, or a ringed wall of whirling blades with a radius of up to 5 ft. per two levels; either form 20 ft. high
- **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)
- **Saving Throw:** Reflex half or Reflex negates; see text
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

An immobile, vertical curtain of whirling blades shaped of pure force springs into existence. Any creature passing through the wall takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6), with a Reflex save for half damage.

If you evoke the barrier so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. Each such creature can avoid the wall (ending up on the side of its choice) and thus take no damage by making a successful Reflex save.

A _blade barrier_ provides cover (+4 bonus to AC, +2 bonus on Reflex saves) against attacks made through it.

No matter how many times you cast this spell, you can control no more than 2 HD worth of celestials per caster level. If you exceed this number, all the newly called creatures fall under your control, and any excess servants from previous castings return to their home plane.

_Abstinence Component:_ The character must abstain from casting Conjuration spells for 3 days prior to casting this spell.

## Command

- **School:** Enchantment (Compulsion) [Language-Dependent, Mind-Affecting]
- **Level:** Cleric 1
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
- **Target:** One living creature
- **Duration:** 1 round
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

You give the subject a single command, which it obeys to the best of its ability at its earliest opportunity. You may select from the following options.

_Approach:_ On its turn, the subject moves toward you as quickly and directly as possible for 1 round. The creature may do nothing but move during its turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity for this movement as normal.

_Drop:_ On its turn, the subject drops whatever it is holding. It can’t pick up any dropped item until its next turn.

_Fall:_ On its turn, the subject falls to the ground and remains prone for 1 round. It may act normally while prone but takes any appropriate penalties.

_Flee:_ On its turn, the subject moves away from you as quickly as possible for 1 round. It may do nothing but move during its turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity for this movement as normal.

_Halt:_ The subject stands in place for 1 round. It may not take any actions but is not considered helpless.

If the subject can’t carry out your command on its next turn, the spell automatically fails.

## Command, Greater

- **School:** Enchantment (Compulsion) [Language-Dependent, Mind-Affecting]

- **Components:** 
- **Casting Time:** 
- **Range:** 
- **Target:** One creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart
- **Duration:** 1 round/level

This spell functions like _command,_ except that up to one creature per level may be affected, and the activities continue beyond 1 round. At the start of each commanded creature’s action after the first, it gets another Will save to attempt to break free from the spell. Each creature must receive the same command.

## Detect Magic

- **School:** Divination
- **Level:** Bard 0, Cleric 0, Druid 0, Sorcerer 0, Wizard 0
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** 60 ft.
- **Area:** Cone-shaped emanation
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 min./level (D)
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No

You detect magical auras. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.

_1st Round:_ Presence or absence of magical auras.

_2nd Round:_ Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.

_3rd Round:_ The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Spellcraft skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura; DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + half caster level for a nonspell effect.)

Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.

_Aura Strength:_ An aura’s power depends on a spell’s functioning spell level or an item’s caster level. If an aura falls into more than one category, _detect magic_ indicates the stronger of the two.

**————————— Aura Power —————————**

| **Spell or Object**             | **Faint**    | **Moderate** | **Strong** | **Overwhelming**    |
| ------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ---------- | ------------------- |
| Functioning spell (spell level) | 3rd or lower | 4th–6th      | 7th–9th    | 10th+ (deity-level) |
| Magic item (caster level)       | 5th or lower | 6th–11th     | 12th–20th  | 21st+ (artifact)    |
|                                 |              |              |            |                     |

_Lingering Aura:_ A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item). If _detect magic_ is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power:

| **Original Strength** | **Duration of Lingering Aura** |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Faint                 | 1d6 rounds                     |
| Moderate              | 1d6 minutes                    |
| Strong                | 1d6x10 minutes                 |
| Overwhelming          | 1d6 days                       |

Outsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if they are summoned, the conjuration spell registers.

Each round, you can turn to detect magic in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.

_Detect magic_ can be made permanent with a _permanency_ spell.

## Dismissal

- **School:** Abjuration
- **Level:** Cleric 4, Sorcerer 5, Wizard 5
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, DF
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
- **Target:** One extraplanar creature
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates; see text
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

This spell forces an extraplanar creature back to its proper plane if it fails a special Will save (DC = spell’s save DC – creature’s HD + your caster level). If the spell is successful, the creature is instantly whisked away, but there is a 20% chance of actually sending the subject to a plane other than its own.

## Dispel Magic

- **School:** Abjuration
- **Level:** Bard 3, Cleric 3, Druid 4, Paladin 3, Sorcerer 3, Wizard 3
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No

You can use _dispel magic_ to end ongoing spells that have been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, to end ongoing spells (or at least their effects) within an area, or to counter another spellcaster’s spell. A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can’t be defeated by _dispel magic_. _Dispel magic_ can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells.

_Note:_ The effect of a spell with an instantaneous duration can’t be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the _dispel magic_ can take effect.

You choose to use _dispel magic_ in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counterspell:

_Targeted Dispel:_ One object, creature, or spell is the target of the _dispel magic_ spell. You make a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +10) against the spell or against each ongoing spell currently in effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 + the spell’s caster level. If you succeed on a particular check, that spell is dispelled; if you fail, that spell remains in effect.

If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by _monster summoning_), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.

If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item’s caster level. If you succeed, all the item’s magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional interface (such as a _bag of holding_) is temporarily closed. A magic item’s physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.

You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.

_Area Dispel:_ When _dispel magic_ is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot radius.

For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or more spells, you make a dispel check against the spell with the highest caster level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against progressively weaker spells until you dispel one spell (which discharges the _dispel magic_ spell so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your checks. The creature’s magic items are not affected.

For each object within the area that is the target of one or more spells, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Magic items are not affected by an area dispel.

For each ongoing area or effect spell whose point of origin is within the area of the _dispel magic_ spell, you can make a dispel check to dispel the spell.

For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the _dispel magic_ spell, you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.

If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by _monster summoning_) is in the area, you can make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel spells targeting the creature or object.

You may choose to automatically succeed on dispel checks against any spell that you have cast.

_Counterspell:_ When _dispel magic_ is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, _dispel magic_ may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster’s spell.

## Divination

- **School:** Divination
- **Level:** Cleric 4
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** Personal
- **Target:** You
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Similar to _augury_ but more powerful, a _divination_ spell can provide you with a useful piece of advice in reply to a question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity that is to occur within one week. The advice can be as simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen. If your party doesn’t act on the information, the conditions may change so that the information is no longer useful. The base chance for a correct _divination_ is 70% + 1% per caster level, to a maximum of 90%. If the dice roll fails, you know the spell failed, unless specific magic yielding false information is at work.

As with _augury_, multiple _divinations_ about the same topic by the same caster use the same dice result as the first _divination_ spell and yield the same answer each time.

- **Material Component:** Incense and a sacrificial offering appropriate to your religion, together worth at least 25 gp.

## Elation

- **School:** Enchantment [Mind-Affecting]
- **Level:** Bard 2, Cleric 2, Sorcerer 3, Wizard 3
- **Source:** Book of Exalted Deeds (BoED) Spells
- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** 80 ft.
- **Target:** Allies in an 80-ft.-radius spread of you
- **Duration:** 1 round/level
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)

Your allies become elated, full of energy and joy. Affected creatures gain a +2 morale bonus to effective Strength and Dexterity, and their speed increases by +5 feet.

Elation does not remove the condition of fatigue, but it does offset most of the penalties for being fatigued.

---

## Entropic Shield

- **School:** Abjuration
- **Level:** Cleric 1
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Personal
- **Target:** You
- **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)

A magical field appears around you, glowing with a chaotic blast of multicolored hues. This field deflects incoming arrows, rays, and other ranged attacks. Each ranged attack directed at you for which the attacker must make an attack roll has a 20% miss chance (similar to the effects of concealment). Other attacks that simply work at a distance are not affected.

---

## Find the Path

- **School:** Divination
- **Level:** Bard 6, Cleric 6, Druid 6
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, F
- **Casting Time:** 3 rounds
- **Range:** Personal or touch
- **Target:** You or creature touched
- **Duration:** 10 min./level
- **Saving Throw:** None or Will negates (harmless)
- **Spell Resistance:** No or Yes (harmless)

The recipient of this spell can find the shortest, most direct physical route to a specified destination, be it the way into or out of a locale. The locale can be outdoors, underground, or even inside a _maze_ spell. _Find the path_ works with respect to locations, not objects or creatures at a locale. The location must be on the same plane as you are at the time of casting.

The spell enables the subject to sense the correct direction that will eventually lead it to its destination, indicating at appropriate times the exact path to follow or physical actions to take. For example, the spell enables the subject to sense trip wires or the proper word to bypass a _glyph of warding._ The spell ends when the destination is reached or the duration expires, whichever comes first. _Find the path_ can be used to remove the subject and its companions from the effect of a _maze_ spell in a single round.

This divination is keyed to the recipient, not its companions, and its effect does not predict or allow for the actions of creatures (including guardians).

- **Focus:** A set of divination counters of the sort you favor.

## Guidance

- **School:** Divination
- **Level:** Cleric 0, Druid 0
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells

- **Target:** Creature touched
- **Duration:** 1 minute or until discharged
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

This spell imbues the subject with a touch of divine guidance. The creature gets a +1 competence bonus on a single attack roll, saving throw, or skill check. It must choose to use the bonus before making the roll to which it applies.

## Lastai's Caress

- **School:** Enchantment (Compulsion) [Good, Mind-Affecting]
- **Level:** Cleric 2
- **Source:** Book of Exalted Deeds (BoED) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Target:** One known evil creature touched
- **Duration:** 1 round/level
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

Your gentle touch fills the target with tremendous feelings of love and compassion, and has the power to unnerve and debilitate evil creatures. You must succeed on a melee touch attack to affect an unwilling target. It has no effect on a creature that you do not know is evil.

An evil creature touched by the spell must wrestle with the pleasant feelings invoked by the spell. Roll on the table below at the beginning of the creature’s turn each round to see what condition applies to the subject in that round.

| d4  | Condition  |
| --- | ---------- |
| 1   | Cowering   |
| 2   | Frightened |
| 3   | Nauseated  |
| 4   | Shaken     |

Instead of rolling on the table above,

the caster may elect to leave the creature

shaken for the duration of the spell.

- **Material Component:** A peach seed.

## Owl’s Wisdom

- **School:** Transmutation
- **Level:** Cleric 2, Druid 2, Paladin 2, Ranger 2, Sorcerer 2, Wizard 2
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M/DF
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Target:** Creature touched
- **Duration:** 1 min./level
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

The transmuted creature becomes wiser. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to Wisdom, adding the usual benefit to Wisdom-related skills. Clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers (and other Wisdom-based spellcasters) who receive _owl’s wisdom_ do not gain any additional bonus spells for the increased Wisdom, but the save DCs for their spells increase.

- **Arcane Material Component:** A few feathers, or a pinch of droppings, from an owl.

## Plane Shift

- **School:** Conjuration (Teleportation)
- **Level:** Cleric 5, Sorcerer 7, Wizard 7
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, F
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Target:** Creature touched, or up to eight willing creatures joining hands
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

You move yourself or some other creature to another plane of existence or alternate dimension. If several willing persons link hands in a circle, as many as eight can be affected by the _plane shift_ at the same time. Precise accuracy as to a particular arrival location on the intended plane is nigh impossible. From the Material Plane, you can reach any other plane, though you appear 5 to 500 miles (5d%) from your intended destination.

_Note: Plane shift_ transports creatures instantaneously and then ends. The creatures need to find other means if they are to travel back.

- **Focus:** A small, forked metal rod. The size and metal type dictates to which plane of existence or alternate dimension the spell sends the affected creatures.

## Prayer

- **School:** Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]
- **Level:** Cleric 3, Paladin 3

## Read Magic

- **School:** Divination
- **Level:** Bard 0, Cleric 0, Druid 0, Paladin 1, Ranger 1, Sorcerer 0, Wizard 0
- **Source:** System Reference Document (SRD) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, F
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Personal
- **Target:** You
- **Duration:** 10 min./level

By means of _read magic,_ you can decipher magical inscriptions on objects—books, scrolls, weapons, and the like—that would otherwise be unintelligible. This deciphering does not normally invoke the magic contained in the writing, although it may do so in the case of a cursed scroll. Furthermore, once the spell is cast and you have read the magical inscription, you are thereafter able to read that particular writing without recourse to the use of _read magic._ You can read at the rate of one page (250 words) per minute. The spell allows you to identify a _glyph of warding_ with a DC 13 Spellcraft check, a _greater glyph of warding_ with a DC 16 Spellcraft check, or any _symbol_ spell with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + spell level).

_Read magic_ can be made permanent with a _permanency_ spell.

- **Focus:** A clear crystal or mineral prism.

## Resist Energy, Mass

- **School:** Abjuration

- **Casting Time:** 
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
- **Target:** One creature/level, no two of which are more than 30 ft. apart
- **Duration:** 

You call upon the protective energies of magical power, surrounding your subjects in temporarily visible fields of energy. Although the fields fade from view, you can still just barely sense their existence.

This spell functions like resist energy (PH 272), except that it affects all targeted creatures.

## Righteous Wrath of the Faithful

- **School:** Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]
- **Level:** Cleric 5
- **Source:** Spell Compendium (SC) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, DF
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** 30 ft.
- **Target:** Allies within a 30-ft.-radius burst centered on you
- **Duration:** 1 round/level
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

When you cast this spell, you fire your allies and companions with a divine madness or fury, greatly enhancing their combat ability.

Allies gain one additional melee attack each round, at their highest attack bonus, when making a full attack. (This additional attack is not cumulative with other effects that grant extra attacks, such as a haste spell.) They also gain a +3 morale bonus on melee attack rolls and damage rolls. (This bonus on melee attack rolls does stack with the bonus provided by haste.)

## Vision of Heaven

- **School:** Enchantment [Mind-Affecting]
- **Level:** Cleric 1
- **Source:** Book of Exalted Deeds (BoED) Spells
- **Components:** V
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
- **Target:** One evil creature
- **Duration:** 1 round
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

Your words allow the target creature the merest glimpse of the blessed joy of the Seven Heavens, spurring the target to a moment of regret for its evil deeds. For 1 round, the target is dazed. In addition, the creature is more susceptible to future redemption. For the next 24 hours, the creature takes a –1 penalty on all Will saves related to redemption (see Chapter 2).

## Wall of Good

- **School:** Abjuration [Good]
- **Level:** Cleric 4, Sorcerer 4, Wizard 4
- **Source:** Spell Compendium (SC) Spells
- **Components:** V, S, M/DF
- **Casting Time:** 1 standard action
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
- **Effect:** A straight wall whose area is up to one 10-ft. square/level or a sphere or hemisphere with a radius of up to 5 ft./2 levels
- **Duration:** 10 minutes/level
- **Saving Throw:** See text
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes

You invoke the abjuration, and a cascade of brilliant white energy springs up in a wall that becomes invisible almost instantly.

You create an immobile barrier that inhibits evil creatures. An evil summoned creature cannot pass through the wall in either direction, and any other evil creature must succeed on a Will save each time it attempts to move through the wall. If the saving throw is failed, the creature’s movement is stopped, and it can take no other action that round.

A wall of good must be continuous and unbroken when formed. If it is cast so that an object or creature breaks its surface, the spell fails.

- **Arcane Material Component:** Powdered silver worth 25 gp.

You cast this spell upon one or more gems, imbuing them with healing energy. The gems leap from your hand, fly to the target, and begin orbiting the target’s head like _ioun stones_.

Each _warding gem_ is a receptacle that holds 10 hp. The target can, as a free action, access the healing energy inside a _warding gem_; the energy is released as a purple-white arc of divine power that unerringly strikes the target, healing 10 points of damage. The target cannot choose to absorb only a portion of a _warding gem’s_ healing power. A _warding gem_ depleted of its healing energy instantly turns to dust. At the end of the spell’s duration, any unspent _warding gems_ lose their healing power and fall to the ground; these can be reused for a later spell.

A single creature can have no more than five _warding gems_ encircling it at one time. A _warding gem_ has AC 24, hardness 10, and 10 hp; if it’s destroyed, any healing power contained within is lost.

_Material Components:_ One 500-gp gem for each _warding gem_ created.
