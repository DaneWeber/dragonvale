From Andy O'Neill:

> In all seriousness -- D&D! Like I tell my wife when she's diligently working at midnight and still doesn't have the next day's lesson plans done: wing it, baby! No one's going to notice. I enjoy the games even when you haven't planned anything. And after all, you know the basic endgame: we're trying to kill evil black forest primitives (so Zulus, basically) at the behest of a magic white woman who controls the water supply (Hillary Clinton) to pay for a cure to Illigrim's bite-transmitted disease (Gonorrhea) applied by a crazy midget and his hippie wife (um . . . Ben and Anna?).

Related to the Mercane deal (from Dane):

The Ogre Mage's greatsword is nothing special. The Mercane will
reluctantly buy it for 50gp (twice what a normal greatsword would go
for).

The Mercane will honor those prices for the case and amulet together
(won't purchase separately) and will give the 50% premium if used in
trade (3000gp & 6900gp, for 9900gp total). You previously had the
items identified (for you to know it was a "planar beacon"). If
someone wearing the amulet uses Plane Shift to travel to the plane on
which the case resides, he will arrive adjacent to the case, rather
than at a random location as usual. This is an unusual item that
cannot be easily found among the best magic shops. Even a Mercane
would be hard-pressed to provide one.

You may indeed be able to find a book entitled, "Towers of the
Planes." Even better, the Mercane hints that it might be able to
provide you with information about "The Plane of Towers."

By the way, those two books in undercommon that you got from the
Blessed's library have descriptions that you may or may not have
noticed:
Book A: stories collected by an underground civilization of victims
whose brains were removed from their bodies.
Book B: apparently by the same author, makes almost no sense, seems to
be a travelog through a dream/nightmare.
