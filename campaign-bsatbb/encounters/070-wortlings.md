## Old Notes

From Andy O'Neill:

> In all seriousness -- D&D! Like I tell my wife when she's diligently working at midnight and still doesn't have the next day's lesson plans done: wing it, baby! No one's going to notice. I enjoy the games even when you haven't planned anything. And after all, you know the basic endgame: we're trying to kill evil black forest primitives (so Zulus, basically) at the behest of a magic white woman who controls the water supply (Hillary Clinton) to pay for a cure to Illigrim's bite-transmitted disease (Gonorrhea) applied by a crazy midget and his hippie wife (um . . . Ben and Anna?).

> And then we're going back to town for looting. I mean, spending our loot.

Vampire hunter is in town still.

In town, the fellows are recognized as the heros of Brindinford and their aid is requested in dealing with a hostage situation. Bowmen have the house surrounded, but the bandits won't come out and they have several women hostage.

Session 9/19/2012:
Fought four animated trees but did not detect the Treant animating them.
Br. Hambone showed up in the top of a tree and jump-kicked an animated tree. Br. Hambone was sent by Lady Eriana. He traded his horse and saddle to a wizard for scrying and then teleportation to the tree-top.
Stag found the trail again and found a clearing with six elf skeletons. Dead more than a month but less than a year. Clothing but no weapons. The victims of the parlay ambush.
Tully became agitated. Black Stag made her more agitated by pretending to find evidence of her sword strikes. The party approached her to capture and interrogate her, but she fled. Hambone kept up with her to try talk her out of running, but then she hid in a shadow. Hambone missed his attempt to strike her. The rest of the part mounted up and will arrive next round.

Stag still has Filth Fever from the punji sticks
Hambone used his Wholeness of Body for the day
Burley used at least 2 lightning bolts and at least 3 flame strikes
