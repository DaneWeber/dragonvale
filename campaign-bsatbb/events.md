    - Encountered a wall ending the path.

          - Thaldrin the Duergar vampire grew to Huge size to carry the swords and escort the party.
      - The Durgar vampire guided the party through his territory, passing below cylindrical stone inverted towers. He waved to the structure, called up in Dwarven that he would return shortly, and left the greatswords.
        - The party continued to Follow the Path down the gap to the end of a chain bridge. Thaldrin observed them from above.
      - After following the path past two branches, the party came to a tunnel highway and turned left, hugging the wall.
        - Many footprints, claw prints, sled marks, and more faded and reappeared repeatedly along the floor.
        - The center of the highway looked the same with darkvision, but appeared as though painted black with normal/lowlight vision. Surfeit, Black Stag, and Tallin all tested the area, barely sticking their fingers in, and felt pain when they did so.
      - Nightwalker and summoned Dread Wraiths
        - Nightwalkers spotted the lights from the party and summoned Dread Wraiths, buffed with Haste, cast deeper darkness, and approached.
        - Illigrim and Black Stag spotted the Nightwalker and halted the party.
        - Casualties:
          - 2 paralyzed lantern archons destroyed by Unholy Blight
          - Two villagers, Grandma Astrid (-1/9) and Young Olaf (-6/4) were injured by the unholy blight and fell unconscious, dying.

        - Wraiths couldn't approach Phil (at the limit of his magic circle against evil)
        - Wraiths drained the paralyzed Illigrim's CON, nearly killing him
        - Surfeit detected a second huge walker, warned everyone, and flew Illigrim away from the wraiths
        - Landorf approached with his prismatic burst bastard sword, which the nightwalker snatched out of his hands and snapped, destroying it
        - The second nightwalker appeared, failing to kill Cade with a Finger of Death.
        - The party otherwise retreated or made ineffective attack.
        - Cade and Burley ended the Shadow Walk spells and returning to the Material Plane
          - They discovered some Large Monstrous Centipedes and killed them, and then holed up in the cave with a pool of water.
          - The party created a door with a bearskin and the two immovable rods to prevent light from giving away their position
          - Tallinn healed the most grievously injured
        - Black Stag was on watch outside of the bearskin door and heard what he believes to be a plane shift.
          - After tense minutes where the animals (Pelor the eagle and Brackenpaw the tiger) detected unnatural presences come and go, Black Stag yelled out "They're back!" followed by screams of ultimate pain.
          - Landorf and Illigrim retrieved Black Stag, who is shriveled.
        - The Supernatural Magic Circles against Evil prevent the summoned wraiths from entering the cave.
        - Phil cast an additional Wall of Good hemisphere with floor to protect the party. The wall intersects with the doorway.
        - Landorf is affected by a spell and begins babbling incoherently.
        - Black Stag uses his Third Eye of Clarity to remove the effect on Landorf.
        - Illigrim retrieves the ring of wishes and places it on his finger.
        - Burley and Phil cast spells to affect the Nightwalkers, but their spells are ineffective due to the Nightwalkers' spell resistance.
        - Surfeit explores the crevice at the bottom of the pool of water and discovers a tunnel leading out into another chamber with monstrous centipedes.
      - With the bearskin closed, the party debates what to do until Illigrim announces his wish loudly:
        - "Great and mighty Pelor, I call upon you to assist us in this dark hour. _I wish_ the mighty Avatar of Pelor would assist us in defeating  these beasts!"
        - Black Stag glows with an inner light, becoming an avatar of Pelor.
          - He doubles in height, his armor becomes radiant, and his sickles growing larger and glowing with holy light.
          - His health/CON is fully restored, and he radiates an aura of sunlight.
          - Following some inspiration, Black Stag blesses his allies' weapons which now also glow with holy light. (Ghost-touch and overcome DR that requires magic, alignment, or metal/material).
        - Burley and Cade damage the wraiths that appear with magic missiles when they reach out to attack Tallinn.
        - Tallinn bursts forth from the cave, but is completely drained of life by the wraiths.
          - The Avatar of Pelor lays hands on Tallinn, restoring him to 1hp and reviving him, preventing him from dying.
        - The Avatar of Pelor attacks the wraiths, destroying one, with the help of the blessed attacks of Landorf, Illigrim, and Brackenpaw the tiger (that is supernaturally encouraged by Pelor to attack and protect Tallinn).
        - The remaining wraith retreats into the cave walls.
        - The Nightwalkers become invisible and position themselves, preparing to attack when the party regroups in the main tunnel.
          - The party will be making saves against the gaze attacks. Illigrim has been affected by one already, but the rest of the party will be making new saves.
      - Party members begin forming up in the main tunnel, looking for the Nightwalkers.
      - COMBAT highlights
        - Nightwalkers attacked with Finger of Death on Burley (made save), Cone of Cold, Unholy Blight, and disarmed Black Stag of one of his sickles, but the epic enhancement on the sickle prevented it from breaking, so the Nightwalker instead threw it behind itself.
        - Black Stag as Avatar of Pelor used Flare to dazzle the Nightwalkers with true daylight and tumbled past them to retrieve the sickle.
        - Bitsy died from unholy blight, but the Avatar of Pelor revivified her after the combat.
        - Illigrim went all in on an attack, missing most hits because his eyes were closed.
        - Landorf leapt and struck with his blessed Frost Brand greatsword.
        - Burley tried another Disintegrate, but failed to overcome the Nightwalkers' SR.
        - Cade used his Disintegrate, overcame the Nightwalkers' SR, and significantly damaged the Nightwalker that eventually escaped. On the following round he shot a lightning bolt along the ceiling to further damage it.
          - The Nightwalker when damaged had holes torn in its skin, revealing bleached bones underneath, some falling out. The skin would close over the holes as best it could.
        - Landorf full-attacked for the most damage prior to the final blow.
        - Illigrim used his final deathstrike for sneak attack damage.
        - Black Stag as the Avatar of Pelor attacked the surrounded Nightwalker and finished it off, the skin tearing away to reveal a pile of bones, corpses, and equipment.
      - Avatar of Pelor revivifies Bitsy and then lays a True Quest on all PCs except for Surfiet who avoided the entire encounter.

        - Detect magic revealed no magical auras on the pile.
        - Divination on the Nightwalker pile of loot:
          - "The threads have been cut, not merely frayed. What remains are shadows of conduits, hollow as abandoned shells upon the shore. No spell can fill what has become fundamentally void."
      - The party decides to hole up in the same cave, but is trying to figure out what to do about the corpses/bones.
