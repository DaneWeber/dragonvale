# Species

This contains notes on the different species. This is just to clarify things that are either left vague in the core material, or to specify what is different and unique.

## OUTSIDERS

### Demons

Demons possess mortals and cause poltergeist. Words have no more meaning or weight to them than the barking of a dog has to man: it might give you information, intimidate another, or even be misleading, but there speaking a "lie" and a "truth" are indistinguishable to the demon. While incredibly intelligent, demons simply desire to pervert, violate, and destroy everything, generally in that order. They are annihilation incarnate, as paradoxical as that is.

### Devils

Devils make deals. They uphold their bargains. They desire power and conquest and do so through bargains, service, and enslavement. They do not possess mortals. They do whisper to them and tempt them and ultimately appear and offer pacts. They also have rules of engagement agreed upon with the Archons.

### Yugoloths

Yugoloths are evil outsiders infrequently found on the Material plane.

### Slaad

The Slaad are beings of contained entropy. They are too driven by whim to organize a mass effort. They do, however, have insight into the nature of change and seem capable of taking advantage of events that seem otherwise entirely chaotic and entropic. Some attempt to harness the same power, and a few even succeed without horrible mutation.

### Axiomatics

The inevitables, modrons, and formians are not only the most highly ordered known beings, but have an insight into the laws of the universe. They have the ability to accomplish things that appear to be magic of some sort, but are actually just a very clever use of inanimate principles. Axiomatic technology and contracts can be found on the Material.

### Archons

Arcons hold that the only way to achieve peace is through the rule of law. They will create, enforce, and obey laws even if this allows evil to survive and flourish in the present. As foolish and rigid as they may appear, they are actually the most cunning of the celestials and evaluate their decisions in terms of the ultimate triumph of holiness, virtue, purity, and charity. They are willing to enter into truce-like pacts with fiends while refusing to give any sign of improriety in their own behavior. Their interaction with mortals is severely curtailed by the rules they follow. Notably, however, Archons make deals in order to be channeled and thus dominate a willing creature, acting through them to accomplish tasks in the Material plane. In fact, desperate pleas to an invisible being to save one from suffering or death in trade for good deads are most likely answered by an Archon planning to call in the favor in the future.

### Guardinals

Guardinals are good above all else. They seek to lead by example. They engage in selfless charity without any agenda or even caring whether anyone is looking (although someone is always looking). Guardinals manifest to mortals more than Archons, but always disguied, rather than in the clear celestial form taken by Archons on business. Guardinals often employ animals to aid mortals or communicate important messages to them. They will also appear in their animal-like form in order to more directly instruct or aid a mortal, while generally appearing to simply be an enchanted creature. The more powerful will polymorph into humanoid form in order to give mortals opportunities to make good decisions and then to directly reward or punish the mortal. If the beggar on the street isn't what he appears, a likely explanation is that he is a Guardinal in disguise. Archons object to this dis-orderly mucking about in mortal affairs and Eladrin object to forcing compliance with the fear of unexpected suffering and the usually unfulfilled hope for temporal reward.

Errata errata: Guardinals with the Polymorph spell-like ability have it, even if errata specifies it removed.

### Eladrin

Eladrin fight for freedom. They hold liberty to be sacred and detest all who seek to impose their will on others. It is where one's own evil desires and acts directly affect others that the Eladrin restrict another. That is, they are only intolerant of the intolerant. They wish to extend mercy to all, even the unrepentant. They hardly care about scandal or dishonor: others are free to think what they like. While the Eladrin detest lies as a pernicious way of oppressing others and seek to expose duplicity and hypocrisy, they believe that the freedom to change one's mind is fundamental and love almost nothing more than helping a mortal violate a diabolic pact. In fact, almost everything an Eladrin says should have "... until I change my mind" appended to it. Most of their influence on the Material plane is felt as suggestions to do the right thing. They also enjoy acting as the agents of karma, rewarding those who are selfless, and punishing those who are selfish, but always in indirect ways.

### Far Realms Creatures

The creatures of the Far Realms are other. They are simply different. They are not more evil or chaotic than Demons. They can cover the entire range of alignments, energies, elements, and more. Their defining feature is simply how alien they are in their operation and mentality. The chaos and evil seen in these creatures is generally a matter of normal creatures not understanding the alien behavior.

## MAGICAL CREATURES

### Lycanthropes and shapechangers

Lycanthropes and shapechangers are creatures of shadow. The moon is their mistress.

## HUMANOID RACES

### Halflings

Halflings, as a people, find niches and stick to them. They are not a conquering race and they generally pack up and relocate rather than fight a war (although they have admirable courage and ingenuity when threatened). In general, Halfling enclaves try to either blend in or even disappear. A Halfling enclave would be pleased if neighboring communities did not know the Halflings were there, and were somewhat mystified by the Halflings that show up occasionally to trade. On the other hand, Halfling communities are usually quite hospitable to guests (although newcomers who stay cease being guests) and Halflings are considered as a whole to be very friendly and good-natured. One curious thing about Halflings is that they seem to take to freshwater boating with greater pleasure than any other race. This leads to a good number of them being traveling as extended families and calling their fleet of small boats home, rather than any stable location.

### Gnomes

Gnomes form a sort of universal brotherhood. Gnomes recognize their fey heritage and treat fellow gnomes as deserving of considerations not made to others. Gnomes have all of the curiosity, entrepreneurial spirit, and wanderlust that Halflings lack. Gnomes travel, adventure, and explore throughout the world with little devotion to their homelands. They set up businesses and enterprises that have never been tried before and attempt to accomplish feats of mechanics, alchemy, and magic that have never been seen before. While they are inveterate tricksters who are not above tricking a man out of his money, their fey ancestry has faded as they have ceased being wild. In fact, it can be said that Gnomes are the domesticated fey. The less domesticated Gnomes live in villages built into hills and trees that are hidden from view by fey magic.

### Dwarves

Dwarves are industrious, loyal, and dedicated. While their greed is legendary, so is their dedication to excellence in their adopted pursuit.

### Elves

Elves are, as a people, far-sighted, with a view to long-term results. While they cannot compete with Dragons and Devils in working for ages to accomplish a complex plan, they do think and act on another level beyond the short-sighted goals of the other populous humanoids. Nearly every grand pursuit has been accomplished by elves, including great cities, ocean-going fleets, and towering libraries, but always in the particular way of the elves, which seeks to integrate all worthy goals into an coherent whole, including aesthetics, lifecycles, contemplation, elegant functionality, elven flourishing, and the ultimate end of all things.
