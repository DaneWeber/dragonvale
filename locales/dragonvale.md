## Geography

### Woods

The kingdom of Hallstadt, with its unique cantonal system of government, resides in the Dragonvale, a heavily wooded valley ringed by sharp-peaked mountains. The trees in the valley are famous for their excellent growth and rapid recovery of cleared land. Among the trees in the valley are tall and strong Fir that are prized as ship masts. Ash, Elm, Pine, and Larch make up much of the woods and are sold along with Fir and sacred Oak for ship-building. Rare Black Oak is the source of the valuable Darkwood, and can be found in the deeper parts of the forest. Maple and Sequoia make up the balance of the woods. The fabled Everwood trees are supposed to grow in the deepest woods.

### Perches

Jutting out above the forest are numerous, but widely spaced, outcroppings of rock locally called "perches." There is generally a perch within or near any settlement, and they can often be used as landmarks to find one's way back to a town. On windy days, the locals claim that the howling of the wind near the perches carry the sounds of dragons roarings, wings flapping, and rock crumbling.

### Forest Residents

Although infrequently seen, elves reside in the woods and make their residence high in the trees, favoring especially the Sequoias, otherwise known as Elfwood. They are generally considered aloof from the concerns of Hallstadt, and their location in the dangerous woods removes them from the regular concerns of the cantons. Less removed are the Gnome Mounds that can be found near the roads. These ancient mounds have rooms dug into the earth that make admirable resting places, but the mounds are difficult to find. Some even claim that fey magic hides them.

### Weather

The weather in the valley is famed for invariably cycling through the seasons with little different year to year. Some of the elders in the valley grumble that the weather is no longer as good for plants, people, or animals as it used to be. Even so, no one can deny that light shows in the sky that happen every few nights are truly spectacular and unique to the valley.

### Unique Features

The valley contains a few other famed geological treasures. Healthful hot springs can be found in several places, but especially near the King's Retreat. Dwarves carve blocks of perfect ice to float down the river via halfling watermen from the Frozen Peak that sits near Waterside. Even though the valley is heavily wooded, it includes Ashardalon's Plain which is a desert of fine gray sand. While hardly a treasure itself, valuable gems have been found beneath the flat sand. Another dubious treasure is the Swampwood. While dangerous and uninviting, it contributes greatly to the diversity of precious herbs
available in the valley.
