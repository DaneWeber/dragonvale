# Neighboring Countries

## Empire of the Full Moon

Very orderly society immediately to the east of the Dragonvale. Everyone trains in unarmed and peasant combat. All conflicts are transacted with mercenaries. The Empire of the Full Moon is heavily sea-faring and is a global economic power. Diplomats travel throughout the world and arrange economic transactions. They also act as money-changers, spreading and maintaining the well-respected imperial coinage. The Empire of the Full Moon prizes the scribes who are able to create contracts enforced by inevitables. The ruling houses of the Full Moon empire pass regency between themselves, maintaining that they are governed by the local regent until such time as the true emperor is recognized.

The denizens, often called Lunars, are characteristically light-skinned and have white, blond, or red hair, and have a variety of eye colors, including hazel, green, blue, and violet. They also prize heterochromia.

## Empire of the Eternal Sun

Complex and depraved society openly ruled by undead to the south of the Dragonvale, past the Hordelands. They rule the former capital city of the Empire and the surrounding desert area. The acceptance of undeath into the empire, and the mummification of the Emperor is what tore apart the empire. Now, the living are second-class citizens. Manual labor is largely performed by mindless undead. Any undead is immediately the property of the Empire. The ruling class of intelligent undead are made so by the emperor's decision. The Empire always had a tremendous navy, but now has boats with rows of oars manned by skeletons.

Because of the influence of the Solars, their fashion is widely prized. Pale skin and black hair with a variety of stylings and accessories make up the core of the fashion, with an ever-changing wardrobe being the costly component. Funerary masks, once the universal practice in the Empire of the Sky, have become a mark of rank reserved to the ruling undead.

## Holy Republican Empire

Dedicated theocracy that maintains a constant war with the Empire of the Eternal Sun, destroying as many undead as possible, while valiantly attempting to spare all life and merely subdue and capture those living who defend the Eternal Emperor. They hold that the ceremonial senate that impeached the Eternal Emperor held true power, and are now ruled by it directly. They refuse to recognize a new emperor, which allows the Empire of the Full Moon to continue under Imperial Regency, as both recognize the emperor to have died upon his ceremonial death as part of his mummification process. The ruling class of the H.R.E. are distinct because of their ebony skin. Dark-skinned immigrants from an imperial conquest formed a class of clergy in the old Empire that became a benevolent but racist ruling class. The H.R.E. borders both the Solars and the Lunars.

## The Free Kings of the West

While caring little for the politics of the empire, the western provinces used the civil war to declare independence and divide into minor kingdoms of questionable historical accuracy. Regardless, the near jungle-like terrain of the western kingdoms made reconquest undesirable. The Free Kings have only vague territorial boundaries, and shifting alliances. Survival is the first priority, although the fortresses held by the Free Kings provide oases of protection. Predators are revered in the jungle and are only to be killed in self-defense or for religious rites. The predators help provide a natural defense. Undead legions are strangely difficult to command in the thick undergrowth and become decimated in short order with no evidence of the missing members.

## Wilds of Larentia

The Wilds of Larentia border the Dragonvale to the northeast, the Hordelands to the southeast, the Eternal Sun Empire to the south, the Free Kings to the west, and the Chasmspan to the north. The Chasmspan is an impressive bridge connecting the continental pieces. The Wilds themselves contain hilly but only sparsely wooded terrain, giving into the jungle of the West. No permanent settlements exist in the Wilds, but halflings are particularly at ease navigating the river. Strange tales filter out about massacres of encampments or even large groups, and many who have wandered off alone return completely insane.

## Hordelands

The center of the continent is vast and difficult to conquer. It is marked by numerous table-lands with steep cliffs. Narrow but swift-flowing rivers create a nearly lace-work pattern around the elevated land. Competing tribes of orcs, barbarians, and giants continually shift their borders and contend for the best land.

## Aerie

The mountain peaks north of the Dragonvale are ruled by the aloof
Giant Eagles. They are content to keep to themselves. Within and
beneath the mountains there may be ancient ruins or deep
civilizations. Dwarven fortresses exist in the Aerie.

## The Chasmspan and the Boiling Rift

North of the Wilds of Larentia is the continental gap. This gap
separates the south continent from the north continent. Towering steep
cliffs line both sides of the gap. The gap averages a thousand feet
across. The water within the rift is generally warm to the touch.
There is a particular area where the water is actually hot, and at low
tide, under certain conditions, the water will reach a boiling
temperature.

Spanning the chasm is the impressive feat of ancient
dwarven engineering, the Chasmspan. It is a hollow stone tube with a
square cross-section that is 40 feet to a side and over five hundred
feet long. There are no pillars or other supports except for the two
ends. While the inside of the tube is only accessible through dwarven
fortresses on each end, the top of the Chasmspan is easily accessible
and people freely drive carts across.

## The Northlands and the Frosty Mountains

North of the Chasmspan is a whole continent that is poorly mapped or
explored. Pockets of civilization exist within the rugged climes.
Tundra, glaciers, and frozen mountains exist near lush valleys,
forests, and swamps. The most prevalent power groups in the Northlands
are Dwarves, Dragons, and Giants. Incursions from the Underdark occur
with regularity in the Northlands.
