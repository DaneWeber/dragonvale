### Amulet of Nullity

This heavy golden amulet appears as though it was constructed by weaving a single loop of cable into an intricate knot. The wearer of the amulet immediately knows the command thought required to activate it, but not what it will do.
Projecting the command thought as a standard action will activate a null psionics (and magic) field in a 10 ft radius for 2 hours, with no ability to dismiss. The amulet draws psychic power from the wielder and warps reality around itself in an unnatural and unsettling way. The wielder is Nauseated while the effect is active (can only take one move action each turn), and is Sickened for another 2 hours afterward. Removing the amulet while active Paralyzes the user and whoever is touching the amulet when it is removed for the remainder of the activation. The death of the weilder ends the effect immediately.
Strong Psychokinesis; ML 12th; Craft Universal Item, null psionics field; Price 100,000 gp; Weight 2 lb.
