# Morality

## Clarifications

Clarification on certain acts and their moral implications in the world of Dragonvale.

For ease of reference, moral transgressions (evil acts) are categorized as follows:

- Trivial: should not result in alignment shift.
- Significant: may result in alignment shift if committed repeatedly.
- Serious: likely to result in alignment shift and/or divine disfavor.
- Heinous/Vile: almost certain to result in an immediate alignment shift and divine disfavor.

### Desecration of Corpses

It is Good to bury the dead, and to treat their remains with respect.

There are varying levels of severity of corpse desecration. With regard to consuming the dead:

- Corpse of non-rational creatures (INT 2 or less): certain Exalted characters have vowed not to consume any meat, but this is otherwise not a moral transgression.
- Corpse of a non-humanoid rational creature (INT 3 or greater, including magical beasts, monstrous humanoids, giants, dragons, fey, etc.): Such an act is a violation of the dignity of the deceased. Eating such creatures that are "always evil" due to their nature, such as chromatic dragons, is a trivial transgression. Eating one that happened to be evil, such as "usually evil" ones, is a significant transgression. It is a serious transgression to eat any rational creature of neutral or good alignment.
- Corpse of a humanoid: serious moral transgression, regardless of the alignment of the humanoid.
