# Morality

## Auras and Alignment

Evil, Law, Chaos, and Good are measurable, quantifiable properties in D&D. While these properties are usually generated by the habits of free-willed creatures (a character's alignment), they can also be imposed upon those same creatures (forced alignment change), inanimate objects can have these properties, the property can be faked or suppressed, and intelligent/rational creatures have these properties in their nature (Outsiders, but also Dragons, Undead, etc.).

An Evil aura is not the same as admission of guilt for heinous crimes deserving of punishment.

## Clarifications

Clarification on certain acts and their moral implications in the world of Dragonvale.

<!-- For ease of reference, moral transgressions (evil acts) are categorized as follows:

- Trivial: should not result in alignment shift.
- Significant: may result in alignment shift if committed repeatedly.
- Serious: likely to result in alignment shift and/or divine disfavor.
- Heinous/Vile: almost certain to result in an immediate alignment shift and divine disfavor. -->

### Cannibalism, Anthropophagy, and Sophontophagy

There are real risks to eating the flesh of sentient beings, including the risk of contracting diseases, being cursed, becoming a ghoul, and spiritual contamination.

It is very frequently immoral to consume the flesh of intelligent beings (INT > 2), although the circumstances and context surrounding the act matter. Many Evil creatures and cultures engage in such consumption as part of their evil, and the inclusion of cannibalism/anthropophagy/sophontophagy exacerbates the gravity of their evil acts.

The moral transgression of consuming the flesh of intelligent beings, setting aside any murder that might be involved, has to do with demonstrating disrespect for the dignity of the creature. The corpse is an object and not a living creature, but it is Good to treat it with respect, which includes appropriate burial, cremation, or similar practices that show honor.
