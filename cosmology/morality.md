# Morality

## Clarifications

Clarification on certain acts and their moral implications in the world of Dragonvale.

For ease of reference, moral transgressions (evil acts) are categorized as follows:

- Trivial: should not result in alignment shift.
- Significant: may result in alignment shift if committed repeatedly.
- Serious: likely to result in alignment shift and/or divine disfavor.
- Heinous/Vile: almost certain to result in an immediate alignment shift and divine disfavor.

### Desecration of Corpses

It is Good to bury the dead, and to treat their remains with respect.

There are varying levels of severity of corpse desecration. With regard to consuming the dead:

- Corpse of non-rational creatures (INT 2 or less): certain Exalted characters have vowed not to consume any meat, but this is otherwise not a moral transgression.
- Corpse of a non-humanoid rational creature (INT 3 or greater, including magical beasts, monstrous humanoids, giants, dragons, fey, etc.): Such an act is a violation of the dignity of the deceased. Eating such creatures that are "always evil" due to their nature, such as chromatic dragons, is a trivial transgression. Eating one that happened to be evil, such as "usually evil" ones, is a significant transgression. It is a serious transgression to eat any rational creature of neutral or good alignment.
- Corpse of a humanoid: serious moral transgression, regardless of the alignment of the humanoid.

#### Metagame Rationale

I'm not claiming that cannibalism is a violation of nature/the natural law.

On a supernatural level, I recognize that Catholic theology is most concerned about the treatment of the dead insofar as it signifies something else (belief in the afterlife, respect for life and the dignity of people, etc.).

Even the physical dangers of disease from cannibalism can be handled with proper precautions (balanced diet, cooking, avoiding brain tissue, etc.).

Reasons for cannibalism being Evil in our D&D setting is based on it matching published D&D material as well as :

- Outside of D&D, legend and folklore often associate cannibalism with depravity, savagery, and desperation.
  - See legends of the ghul, wendigo, etc.
  - Evil giants grind and eat the bones of their victims.
  - Eating a talking animal was immoral in Narnia (The Silver Chair).
- Outside of D&D, cannibalism is associated with the vicious man, not the virtuous one. While the murder that usually precedes the cannibalism is reason enough to condemn a cannibal, I don't believe that we would praise an "ethical cannibal" that sources non-murdered meat.
- Also outside of D&D, "burying the dead" is a corporal work of mercy which is behind my statement about it being "Good." I'm not saying it's the only non-Evil option, but it is definitely a Good act.
- The Ghoul in D&D is an evil undead creature that is most notable for feeding on humanoid flesh (called _anthropophagous_ in the text). It is also stated that "Ghouls are said to be created upon the death of a living man or woman who savored the taste of the flesh of people."
- D&D monsters who are known to consume humanoid flesh (barghests, ghouls, chromatic dragons, etc.) are almost universally evil. A counter-example would significantly weaken this point, but I haven't found one.
- Creating undead is primarily Evil because of the desecration of corpses involved.
- The _Book of Vile Darkness_ includes Corrupt spells with the Evil descriptor (Absorb Mind, Absorb Strenght, Consume Likeness, etc.) where the main/only reason is the inclusion of cannibalism as part of the spell.
