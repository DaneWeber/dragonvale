# Cosmology

## Souls

The evidence of variable degrees of martial and mystical prowess, along with the manner in which infusing items with power and having one's "life force" lessened by the dark powers, leads to the hypothesis of chthonic power. Chthonic power is the most fundamental power of a being. It remains after death for a time and returns with the soul should magic require it. It is highly believable that creatures on the outer planes barter in the chthonic power of the deceased.

In order to most efficiently increase your own chthonic power, without resorting to infernal pacts or similar extreme measures, one must discern the nature of his own soul. Some races are all of a single animate nature, but the great mortal races have a variety of animate natures.

- Dragon/Time - increase over time alone
- Mundane/Flat - no increase
- Ooze/Decay - decrease over time and activity
- Barghest/Consumption - increase by consuming other beings
- Swarm/Combination - increase through unification with another
- Outsider/Unknown - mysterious changes
- Scholar/Learning - increase through knowledge of secrets, generally best served by a scholarly dedication, although martial secrets also serve
- Ruler/Followers - increase by gaining social power (the inverse of the Leadership setup)
- Master/Practice - increase by practicing one's art
- Expert/Veteran - increase by performing one's duties successfully
- Hero/Danger - increase by entering dangerous situations and returning victorious

The different natures not only determine how chthonic power is gained, but also how and whether one can be brought back from the afterlife. The Hero type is the easiest to recall. The Expert, Master, Ruler, and Scholar types may be recalled, but often require more powerful magic to do so, or may be impossible.

## Gods

see [Deities](deities.md)

Gods are gods. They exist, are powerful, and are not to be ignored or disrespected lightly. Evil is evil, but the dark gods cannot be shunned lightly. While culture differs greatly from one land to the next, the Dragonvale is not unusual in setting aside places and times to appease the dark gods. A cleric of a dark god may also command a certain respect, and certainly is not immediately treated as a criminal, even though everyone strongly suspects him of engaging in horrendous acts.

While one might think that at least the dark gods are treated differently from the lighter gods because they are feared rather than loved, one would be wrong. The lighter gods, including even the most resplendent, are feared as well. It would be foolish not to fear them, just as only a fool would not fear a Golden Wyrm. Appeasing the gods is simply wise, and it is not evil to appease the evil gods, just as it is not evil to pay a ransom for a kidnapped child. One might wish to otherwise correct the situation, but when it comes to the gods, there is not much one can do.

The gods are not pitted against each other, attempting to win converts or to even gain followers. That is not the way of the gods. They have designs on each other, but mortals could not hope to influence the outcome. The gods meddle in the world because they want to. It is the celestials and fiends that desire souls. The gods do as they please.

## Undead

Undead are detestable because they generally mock both life and death. The desecration of the body involved in creating undead is, itself, twisted. There is nothing inherently evil about negative energy, just as there is nothing inherently good about positive energy (which heals fiends and celestials alike). However, many uses of negative energy are quite twisted and evil, especially because many of them give rise to irredeemably evil beings. So, the necromancer is shunned in decent society because he generally engages in despicable acts. Even so, the temple of Wee Jas provides a haven for necromancy. Jasidans care more about corpses being lawfully acquired with the consent of the dead than about what is done with the corpse, and officially prescind from judging whether the generation of a given undead being was an evil act. The temple of Wee Jas is held to be the executor of all wills by default, and it is within this capacity that the temple determines the legitimacy of necromantic acts. Furthermore, commanding and rebuking the undead is not evil, even if creating them is. If a necromancer could find a way to lawfully create undead that were not evil, he need not be evil himself, especially if he engaged in no murder or desecration of corpses.

Ghosts are a special class of undead. In fact, most "ghosts" simply transit from the departed via the Deep Ethereal to the river Styx, which acts as a conduit to the Outer planes. This is a disappointingly mundane method of transit to most who study these matters. The ghost is not only incorporeal on the Ethereal, but also is energy-neutral and essentially invulnerable. The ghost may make its way on its own, but often is met by guides, and may even be contested by creatures of the Outer planes. Only ghosts that refuse to cooperate remain for any meaningful period of time, and it is these that gather negative energy to themselves in order to exert their will upon the world.
