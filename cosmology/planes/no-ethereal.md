# Planes without an Ethereal Plane

This is all Outer Planes and the Shadow Plane.

Each Inner Plane has its own Ethereal Plane that connects to the Ethereal Plane of the Material Plane via the Deep Ethereal.

## Magic Implications

(Primarily from the Manual of the Planes)

Spells that require the Ethereal Plane do not function on planes without an Ethereal Plane.

- blink
- chamber
- ethereal jaunt
- etherealness
- ether blast
- Leomund's secret chest

The same applies to magic items that replicate these spells, such as the _oil of etherealness_.
