# Shadow Plane

While ghosts primarily exist on the Ethereal plane, undead in general have a greater connection to the plane of Shadow. It isn't that the plane provides negative energy, but that the plane is a comfortable and fitting place for them. The Shadow plane is the substrate of memories and images. Illusions also draw upon this plane as well. Shapechangers and lycanthropes are at home here and may even have a stronger connection to this plane. When the moon is full, truth can be seen and shadow creatures are either banished or revealed in their true form. The full moon prevents magical access to the plane of Shadow. During the darkness of the new moon, nearly the reverse is true: many dark shadows become portals to the plane, many creatures of shadow enter and prowl about, and illusions of all sorts are stronger. The plane of Shadow retains the echoes of events from the past, and provides information for some divinations and even necromantic magic. While the plane of Shadow is the most easily accessible plane, and also the most spatially normal plane adjacent to the Material, it is also the most baffling. Perhaps the best way to understand this plane is to think of it as only partially real.

The Shadow plane is the easiest to stumble across. Creatures on the plane of Shadow can peer out of shadows on the Material and potentially enter the Material through shadows. Curiously, the ability of a creature to peer out from and exit the plane of Shadow is inverse to its chthonic power (the more powerful creatures require deeper shadow), and it is much easier to peer out than to exit. Further, certain creatures have a greater affinity for the plane of Shadow than others, and have a kind of sense about what shadows can be used for crossing and also have an easier time crossing. This is a property of the plane reaching out to the creatures rather than an innate power they have. Beyond the obvious shadow creatures, lycanthropes and their kin (wolves, rats, bears, boars, tigers, etc.) have a great affinity for Shadow, as do all shapechangers and intelligent undead. Animals with black fur, feathers, or skin also have this affinity. The affinity affects not only the creature itself, but all nearby, meaning that creatures can more easily enter the Material from the plane of Shadow were affinity creatures are near shadows, and creatures can also more easily pass into the Shadow when accompanying an affinity creature.

The River Lethe is said to flow on the Shadow plane. Others say that the plane itself is the River Lethe. Losing one's shadow or one's shade is another term for losing one's memory, and crossing the River Lethe indicates that one has lost one's memory.
