## Boccob, the Uncaring Archmage

Neutral Deity of Magic, Education, Libraries, and Knowledge

Patron of Cartographers, Educators, Linguists, Bookwrights, Librarians, Papermakers, Scribes, Alchemists, Diviners, and Mages.

Domains: Knowledge, Magic, Trickery, Rune

Description: Boccob is the mage of the gods. He cares about understanding the nature of things beyond anything else. While his understanding gives him great power, he has no special desire to hide learning from others. Anyone trying to understand a new study prays that Boccob will grant them insight.

Clergy: The premier group of Boccobites is the Temple of Philosophy, which is an organization that dedicates itself building up and preserving libraries of knowledge under the patronage of Boccob. Access to these libraries is restricted to members because while the accumulation and preservation of knowledge is the aim of the Temple, spreading that knowledge is not. Membership is open to all who can demonstrate scholastic ability and achievement. Generally a significant new contribution to the collections of the Temple is a key to acceptance. There are no requirements that members be endowed with magical ability, but magic-users are certainly drawn to the Temple of Philosophy. Devotion to Boccob is key to the activities of the members of the Temple. As such, those endowed with magical power by Boccob hold preeminence in the organization and certain key roles are reserved for those wielding Boccob's divine magic. Wizards make up much of the rest of the spell-casting caste within the Temple, and they frequently attain some of the most important roles as well.

Temple: Oddly enough, the Temple of Philosophy does not maintain any temples. The locked and guarded libraries are the buildings that the Temple maintains. Independent from the Temple, local devotees of Boccob maintain publicly available buildings called studios. Studios provide a large room with tables, chairs, and lighting. The studio provides a space for students and teachers to meet, either in a corner for relatively private instruction, or en mass as a class. While wizards rarely share their knowledge freely, they do sometimes offer introductory classes in order to find pupils with magical aptitude.

Ceremonies: Reading or scribing a book is an act of devotion to Boccob. The actual ceremonies carried out by Boccobites involve demonstrations of knowledge, recitations, divinations, and even the magical exchange of texts with Boccob's library.

## Obad-Hai, the Callous Woodwose

Neutral Deity of Nature, Wilderness, Waterways, and Weather

Patron of Fishermen, Herbalists, and Watermen.

Domains: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Water, Weather

Description: Obad-Hai is a wild and inscrutable being. While some think of him as connected with woods, it is more the untamed land that he cares for. Deep virgin forest is certainly a favorite of his, but ranks with dangerous swamps, harsh deserts, and rolling wastelands. Of course, his sacred tree, the oak, lends to his connection with the woods. Those in many different ways of life pray that Obad-Hai grant them good weather, but all know that such prayers do little to affect his whims.

Domains: Death, Law, Magic, Repose

Description: Wee Jas is a cold and regal queen. She demands nothing short of perfection (or at least its appearance). Mortals trust that she will watch over their passage into the afterlife. While she may not care about them, at least she will make sure that they are not way-laid along the path.

Clergy: The Jasidans are the clergy of Wee Jas. When they enter Jasidan service, they cut off all relations and consider themselves to have died and enter a temple through the corpse gate. They wear stylized cosmetics, both male and female, as well as ornate robes and jewelry. The have a complex hierarchy that carries out its business is a formalized manner. The Jasidans travel and converse with ordinary people to an unusual degree. While they do inspect the operations of those seeking the patronage of Wee Jas, they also seem to involve themselves with the affairs of completely unrelated people and generally act as though they are owed special consideration by all. Of course, perhaps all mortals do owe them something.

Temple: Only the dead and the clergy of Wee Jas are allowed into the temple proper. They have a foyer for conducting business, and they have an enclosed porch where the dead can be brought and where funeral processions can organize.

Ceremonies: Most know the Jasidans for their funeral rites. After the proper preparations, the Jasidans organize a procession of the corpse in its casket to the grave and engage in ritualized wailing for the deceased before the corpse in interred. The Jasidans have less publicized services that they offer, although seemingly always in private.

Patron of Moneylenders, Gemcutters, Glaziers, Jewelers, Cottars, Dyers, and Jesters.

Domains: Good, Protection, Trickery

Temple: Garl's palaces are ostentatious affairs that are just a bit silly. The gatekeeper demands that you make him laugh. If you can't get him to laugh, then you have to play a game of Thimblerig to get in. Alternatively, you can simply bring a glittery bauble or gem as an offering for entrance. Among other things, the main hall generally features some major illusion set up both to confuse visitors until they trustfully step into it and as an homage to the Grand Trickster. Garl's palaces usually have a special blessing of Glittergold's that enhance illusions, allowing them to last, and making them more believable. The palaces often have oddly-angled passageways, almost universally hidden by illusion or secret door.

Domains: Animal, Good, Plant, Sun, Charm

Description: Ehlonna is a gentle goddess who wants civilization to flourish in harmony with nature. Ehlonnaâ€™s form of hunting and husbandry is that of one attuned to the animal and grateful for the benefits received. Cruel or wanton use of animals and woodlands is not her style. She also smiles upon those engaged in the hunt for a spouse which also requires respect for the game. The unicorn is her sacred beast, and is to be molested by none.

Clergy: The clergy of Ehlonna generally wear practical and serviceable garments beneath their decorative tabards and surcoats which are white and green and generally have a unicorn crest incorporated. An ordinary member of the clergy is a Handmaid of the Huntress, and the temple leader is a Head of the Household.

Temple: The main area of a Household of the Huntress is a large room with numerous pillars called "The Clearing." The pillars are decorated to look like tree trunks, or are in fact unworked trees. The floors, walls, and ceiling are decorated to be reminiscent of a forest. A basin rests on the floor and is kept clean and filled with water by the clergy, although pouring a bucket of clean water into the basin is considered an act of devotion. Travelers are welcome to set up camp within the Clearing and stay overnight. Attached to the Clearing is the Household in which the clergy reside. The Household has rooms used for meetings with the public, as well as private quarters.

Ceremonies: All services offered within the Clearing are carried out in the same way they are carried out in the woods: all components, altars, and other equipment are carried in at the beginning and cleared away at the end.

Domains: Chaos, Luck, Trickery, Community

Description: While some say that craft and trade bring cities together, Olidammara patronizes neither. He supports the gathering of people for laughter and festivity.

Temple: What does Good Ol' Olly need with a temple? Every gathering of merry-makers is a congregation and every tavern is a high temple. Some cities do set up a temple, but it generally just houses one or two clergy and a warehouse of offerings made to the Grand Merrymaker. These offerings are brought out for great street parties on Olly's feast days.

Evil Deity of the Sea, Darkness, Nightmares, and Revenge

Patroness of Sailors and Traitors
